From the misty, legendary castles to the soaring, misty mountains, our trip was an unforgettable adventure for both me and my daughter. We discovered a country that is full of surprises, a place of history, stunning landscapes, and a unique mix of cultures.\n\n### Our Romanian Adventure Begins\n\nOur Romanian story began the moment we landed at Otopeni Airport (OTP). Right there, we picked up our rental car—a big, comfortable Skoda Kodiaq. It was a 7-seater, perfect for our group: my family from and my friends' family, all traveling together. Having a big car was the best decision, giving us the freedom to explore Romania at our own pace. The car was our little home on wheels for the whole trip.\n\n### Day 1 & 2: The Land of Dracula\n\nOur first destination was the heart of Transylvania, the land famous for vampires and folklore. My childhood memories of playing Dracula games with my cousins came flooding back. Now, as a grown-up, I was here with my daughter, chasing those same stories. It was a journey we both wanted to take, inspired by my old games and her new movies like *Hotel Transylvania*.\n\nOur first stop was Bran Castle, often called \"Dracula's Castle.\" It stands high on a rocky hill, looking just like the kind of place a vampire count would live. The castle is a beautiful, old fortress with tall towers and dark wood. Even though we know that the real Vlad the Impaler, the ruler who inspired the Dracula story, only visited this place and didn't live here, the castle still feels magical. Walking through its narrow stairways and stone rooms, you can almost hear the whispers of history. My daughter and I were in awe of the castle's ancient walls and the amazing views of the green hills all around.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/18.webp)\n![](/images/romania/7.webp)\n![](/images/romania/1.webp)\n![](/images/romania/8.webp)\n![](/images/romania/9.webp)\n![](/images/romania/13.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nFrom Bran, we traveled to Sighișoara, a town that feels like a time machine. Sighișoara is a medieval town, meaning it is very, very old. The streets are made of round stones, and the houses are painted in bright colors like yellow, blue, and red. It's so beautiful that the old town is a UNESCO World Heritage site. This is a very special place because it is the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler.\n\nWe found the very house where he was born in the year 1431. Today, this old house has a restaurant inside. We had a meal there, thinking about how we were sitting in the same place where a famous historical figure once lived.\n\nWe also heard about a special room for tourists, but we were glad we took a chance and decided to go inside. The plan was for my daughter and my friend's daughter to explore the Dracula room upstairs. However, the entrance was already quite scary, with spooky music and dim lighting, and my friend's little daughter got too frightened to go in. So, it was just me and my daughter, ready for the adventure!\n\nWe walked through the entrance, which was decorated with creepy props, and climbed the stairs to the main room. The air felt thick with mystery. In the center of the room, surrounded by other eerie objects, we saw it: a coffin, half-open. My daughter was pushing me to go ahead, a little nervous but also full of excitement. As I moved closer to the coffin, a figure slowly opened its lid. It was Dracula himself, with a pale, long face and the traditional dark clothes. To make the moment more dramatic for my daughter, I pretended to be scared and jumped back with a gasp.\n\nThe actor, still lying in the coffin, must have thought I was truly frightened. He spread out his hand in a gesture of reassurance. I took his hand and gave him a friendly shake. My daughter watched with wide eyes, pulling on my arm and whispering for us to hurry and leave, still a little scared but also fascinated by the whole experience.\n\nAs we walked back down the stairs, she told me that she knew it was a human, but she was still scared. And then she said something that made my heart melt: \"I feel pity for him. It was quite warm in the room!\" In that moment, she wasn't just thinking of a scary vampire; she was thinking of a person doing a job. it was a funny and touching end to our vampire hunt, a memory we will never forget.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/2.webp)\n![](/images/romania/23.webp)\n![](/images/romania/5.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIt was the perfect finale to our day, and we drove back to our hotel, looking forward to the next part of our adventure. The following morning, we set out on the road again.\n\n### Day 3 & 4: The Road to the Sky\n\nAfter the castles and towns, it was time for a change of pace.\n\nOne of the most pleasant parts of our drive was traveling through the small Romanian villages. The scenery changed from the busy city to peaceful country roads. We saw beautiful wooden houses with decorated gates and colorful flowers in every garden. People waved at us, and we waved back. The air was clean and fresh, and we enjoyed seeing the simple, beautiful life of the countryside.\n\nWe drove towards the famous Carpathian Mountains. This mountain range is a big part of Romania, with tall peaks and deep forests. We took a special road called the Transfăgărășan Highway. People call it \"the Road to the Sky\" because it climbs up and up, winding its way through the mountains.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/15.webp)\n![](/images/romania/12.webp)\n![](/images/romania/3.webp)\n![](/images/romania/6.webp)\n![](/images/romania/22.webp)\n![](/images/romania/24.webp)\n![](/images/romania/20.webp)\n![](/images/romania/17.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe Transfăgărășan is not just a road; it's an adventure. It has many twists and turns, like a long snake. The views from the car window were breathtaking. We saw thick forests, rocky cliffs, and waterfalls. This road was built a long time ago by a Romanian leader. It is so high up that it is only open in the summer months when there is no snow. Driving this road felt like being on top of the world.\n\nOur mountain adventure continued with a hike. We started at a beautiful place called Bâlea Lake. From there, we walked to another lake, Lake Capra. The weather was not sunny and clear; it was foggy and misty, and it started to rain. At first, we were a little sad, thinking we wouldn't see much. But the fog and rain made the hike even more special.\n\nThe mountains looked like a mystery, with the fog hiding the tops of the peaks. The path was slippery, and we had to be careful with every step. The air was cool and fresh. The sounds of the rain and the wind were all we could hear. This hike taught us that nature's beauty can be found even on a rainy day. It wasn't about seeing everything from a distance; it was about feeling the mountain's power and being part of its wild beauty.\n\n### A Mix of Worlds\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7k3Ao8nq2I\n\nAs we drove back from the mountains, we saw more of Romania. One thing that was surprising was the traffic in the big cities. It was busy and a little crazy, reminding me of some cities in Asia. This mix of cultures and styles is what makes Romania so unique—it feels like a bridge between different parts of the world.\n\nWe also noticed many churches. In villages and cities, and even on the side of country roads, we saw small crosses and statues of Christ. It showed us how important faith is to the people here.\n\nAnd of course, we had to try the food! We ate many nice meals. And for a special treat, we enjoyed a fizzy Coke, which tasted even better after our long drives and hikes. Sometimes the places were a bit crowded with other people, but that just showed how many people love this country.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/21.webp)\n![](/images/romania/19.webp)\n![](/images/romania/11.webp)\n![](/images/romania/10.webp)\n![](/images/romania/14.webp)\n![](/images/romania/25.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nOur trip to Romania was a mix of everything: the old stories of vampires and the real history of rulers, the beauty of the Transfăgărășan road, and the peaceful, misty mountains. It was a journey that went beyond just visiting places; it was a journey into a country's heart, a place of magic, history, and nature's amazing power. We left with our minds full of beautiful pictures and our hearts full of wonderful memories.\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
