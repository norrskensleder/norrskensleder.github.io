So we decided to go to **Copenhagen**, the capital of **Denmark**.\n\n### Crossing the Øresund Bridge\n\nOne fine morning, we took the **Øresund train** from Malmö to Copenhagen. The train crosses the famous [**Øresund Bridge**](https://visitskane.com/classic-attractions/oresund-bridge), a long bridge that connects **Sweden** and **Denmark**. It’s amazing to travel from one country to another in just about 40 minutes!\n\n### First Stop: The Little Mermaid\n\nOur first plan was to meet **The Little Mermaid**, the most famous statue in Copenhagen. We got off the train at **Østerport Station**, and from there it was only about 15 minutes’ walk.\n\nThe statue is near [**Kastellet Fortress**](https://www.kastellet.com/en/to-do/museum/), a beautiful old fort surrounded by water and walking paths. We walked through the quiet park, and finally — there she was!\n\nIt was a cloudy October day, typical weather for Scandinavia. The sky was grey, and the sea was calm. The Little Mermaid looked a bit sad — maybe because of the gloomy weather — and it showed in all our photos too!\n\n### Who is The Little Mermaid?\n\nThe Little Mermaid is a **bronze sculpture** made by [**Edvard Eriksen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Eriksen) in **1913**. She is based on the famous fairy tale by Danish writer [**Hans Christian Andersen**](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Christian-Andersen-Danish-author).\n\nThe story is about a young mermaid who falls in love with a prince. She dreams of becoming human and gives up her voice to live on land. It’s a story of love, hope, and sadness — and that’s why the statue also looks thoughtful and lonely.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/little_mermaid/2.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/3.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/4.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/5.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/6.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n### Behind the scene\n\nHere’s a lovely part of the story:\nA Danish brewer named [**Carl Jacobsen**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/175-years/a-history-of-brewing/carl-jacobsen/), who also founded the [**Carlsberg**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/) beer company, went to see a **ballet performance** of *The Little Mermaid* at the [**Royal Danish Theatre**](https://kglteater.dk/en).\n\nHe loved the story so much that he asked the sculptor **Edvard Eriksen** to make a statue of the mermaid. The dancer who played the mermaid in the ballet inspired him, but she didn’t want to model for the sculpture — so Eriksen’s **wife, [Eline Eriksen](https://dbpedia.org/page/Eline_Eriksen)**, posed instead!\n\nSo, the Little Mermaid you see today is partly inspired by art, love, and family — a true Danish creation.\n\n### A Tough Life\n\nEven though she looks peaceful, the Little Mermaid has had a difficult life. Over the years, some people have damaged her many times.\n\n* In **1964**, someone cut off her head!\n* In **1984**, her arm was removed — but returned a few days later.\n* In **1998**, her head was stolen again but later found and replaced.\n* In **2003**, she was pushed into the water!\n\nSometimes she is also painted or dressed up during protests. Still, she always comes back — strong and smiling again.\n\n### Symbol of Copenhagen\n\nThe Little Mermaid is more than just a statue. She is a **symbol of Copenhagen** — just like the **Eiffel Tower** is for Paris or the **Statue of Liberty** is for New York.\n\nShe reminds visitors of Denmark’s love for art, stories, and the sea. Even though she is small, she has a big place in the hearts of people all around the world.\n\n**Travel Tip:**\nThe best time to visit The Little Mermaid is early in the morning or late in the evening — when there are fewer tourists. Bring a jacket (it’s windy near the water!) and take a quiet moment to enjoy the view of the harbour.\n\n### What’s Next?\n\nAfter spending some quiet time with the Little Mermaid, we started walking again — this time towards Amalienborg Palace, the royal home of the Danish Queen. The beautiful palace square and the changing of the guards were waiting for us!\n\n👉 Read the next part of our “Trip in Denmark” series: A Royal Morning at Amalienborg Palace.\n"},{"slug":"we-found-nemo-and-dory-at-northern-europes-largest-aquarium","title":"We Found Nemo (and Dory!) at Northern Europe’s Largest Aquarium","date":"2025-08-22","tags":["travel","culture","denmark","scandinavia"],"coverImage":"/images/blue_planet/16.webp","content":"To celebrate my daughter’s 7th birthday, we wanted to do something truly unforgettable — something that would open her eyes to the wonders of the world beneath the sea. Just a few metres from the Øresund strait in Copenhagen sits a place that does exactly that: Den Blå Planet, the National Aquarium of Denmark. This is Northern Europe’s largest, most state-of-the-art aquarium, and it offers not only an impressive collection of marine life, but also a full sensory journey into the mysteries of the ocean.\n\n## First Impressions – A Building Like a Whirlpool\n\nFrom the outside, Den Blå Planet immediately captures your attention. Its architecture is inspired by the swirling motion of a whirlpool — sleek curves of steel and glass that almost appear to be in motion themselves. Walking toward the entrance, you already feel like you’re being pulled into another world.\n\nOnce inside, guests step straight into the “vortex” — a curved lobby that branches into the aquarium’s three main sections. From here, you’re drawn into a labyrinth of 53 aquariums and installations holding more than seven million liters of water, home to thousands of animals from around the globe.\n\n## Getting In – Skipping the Line but Not the Wait\n\nWe had purchased our tickets online, which meant we could skip the ticket counter. However, Den Blå Planet controls visitor numbers carefully to ensure that each guest has the best possible experience. This meant we waited about half an hour at the entrance before being allowed inside. It was a small inconvenience, but once we stepped in, the wait was well worth it.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Alligator gar](/images/blue_planet/6.webp)\n![The big Aquarium](/images/blue_planet/9.webp)\n![Shark](/images/blue_planet/2.webp)\n![Bioluminescent corais macios](/images/blue_planet/11.webp)\n![Stingray](/images/blue_planet/7.webp)\n![Xingu River ray](/images/blue_planet/10.webp)\n![Nemo is looking at us!](/images/blue_planet/1.webp)\n![Seahorse](/images/blue_planet/3.webp)\n![The Golden Poison Frog](/images/blue_planet/5.webp)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/8.webp)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/12.webp)\n![Sharks](/images/blue_planet/18.webp)\n![Red-bellied piranha](/images/blue_planet/13.webp)\n![Dory!

Digital screens provide detailed information about the animals, and with the press of a button, you can switch between Danish and English.\n\nThroughout the day, there are scheduled activities and live feedings. One of the highlights for me was watching the piranha feeding — equal parts thrilling and educational.\nTo make sure everyone, especially children, has a chance to enjoy the exhibits, Den Blå Planet has marked viewing spots in front of the larger tanks. Families can stand there without blocking others, and kids can enjoy an unobstructed view of the marine life. It’s a thoughtful detail that makes the visit more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n## Tropical Rainforest – A Living Jungle\n\nOne of the most surprising and delightful areas was the tropical rainforest section. It felt like stepping into a miniature jungle: warm air, lush greenery, and the sounds of exotic creatures. Tiny frogs hopped across the pathways, so you had to watch your step carefully. My daughter loved this part, giggling every time she spotted a frog hiding among the leaves. The rainforest also includes other fascinating species, offering a glimpse into ecosystems beyond the ocean.\n\n## The Shark Tunnel – Walking Beneath the Waves\n\nThe true showstopper, however, was the shark tunnel. Imagine walking through a long glass corridor while sharks, giant stingrays, and sea turtles glide gracefully above and around you. The sheer size of the tank makes you feel as if you’ve shrunk and stepped right into the ocean. For children — and adults too — it’s a mesmerizing experience, one that inspires both awe and respect for marine life.\n\n## Interactive Fun for Kids\n\nDen Blå Planet isn’t just about looking — it’s about experiencing. There are touch pools where children (under staff supervision) can gently interact with marine animals. For a 7-year-old birthday girl, this was a dream come true — she got to feel the texture of sea stars and other fascinating creatures, making the day even more special.\nPractical Information – Planning Your Visit\nDen Blå Planet is open 365 days a year, including holidays:\n\n- Monday: 10 am – 9 pm\n- Tuesday – Sunday: 10 am – 5 pm\n- Saturdays (annual pass holders): 9 am – 10 am early entry\n- Peak seasons: daily 10 am – 9 pm\n\nThe building itself covers 10,000 m² indoors with an additional 2,000 m² outdoor area plus parking facilities, so there’s plenty of space to explore.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJY5hgfYkcg\n\n## A Day to Remember\n\nThere are impressive aquariums all over the world, but Den Blå Planet truly stands out for its combination of architecture, atmosphere, and attention to detail. Whether spotting Nemo and Dory or walking through the mesmerizing shark tunnel, the aquarium offers an unforgettable glimpse into the mysteries of the sea.\n\nIf you find yourself in Copenhagen, this is an attraction you shouldn’t miss. For us, it wasn’t just a day at the aquarium — it was an adventure, a birthday gift of wonder and discovery that my daughter (and all of us) will never forget.\n"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
