So we decided to go to **Copenhagen**, the capital of **Denmark**.\n\n### Crossing the √òresund Bridge\n\nOne fine morning, we took the **√òresund train** from Malm√∂ to Copenhagen. The train crosses the famous [**√òresund Bridge**](https://visitskane.com/classic-attractions/oresund-bridge), a long bridge that connects **Sweden** and **Denmark**. It‚Äôs amazing to travel from one country to another in just about 40 minutes!\n\n### First Stop: The Little Mermaid\n\nOur first plan was to meet **The Little Mermaid**, the most famous statue in Copenhagen. We got off the train at **√òsterport Station**, and from there it was only about 15 minutes‚Äô walk.\n\nThe statue is near [**Kastellet Fortress**](https://www.kastellet.com/en/to-do/museum/), a beautiful old fort surrounded by water and walking paths. We walked through the quiet park, and finally ‚Äî there she was!\n\nIt was a cloudy October day, typical weather for Scandinavia. The sky was grey, and the sea was calm. The Little Mermaid looked a bit sad ‚Äî maybe because of the gloomy weather ‚Äî and it showed in all our photos too!\n\n### Who is The Little Mermaid?\n\nThe Little Mermaid is a **bronze sculpture** made by [**Edvard Eriksen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Eriksen) in **1913**. She is based on the famous fairy tale by Danish writer [**Hans Christian Andersen**](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Christian-Andersen-Danish-author).\n\nThe story is about a young mermaid who falls in love with a prince. She dreams of becoming human and gives up her voice to live on land. It‚Äôs a story of love, hope, and sadness ‚Äî and that‚Äôs why the statue also looks thoughtful and lonely.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/little_mermaid/2.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/3.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/4.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/5.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/6.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n### Behind the scene\n\nHere‚Äôs a lovely part of the story:\nA Danish brewer named [**Carl Jacobsen**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/175-years/a-history-of-brewing/carl-jacobsen/), who also founded the [**Carlsberg**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/) beer company, went to see a **ballet performance** of *The Little Mermaid* at the [**Royal Danish Theatre**](https://kglteater.dk/en).\n\nHe loved the story so much that he asked the sculptor **Edvard Eriksen** to make a statue of the mermaid. The dancer who played the mermaid in the ballet inspired him, but she didn‚Äôt want to model for the sculpture ‚Äî so Eriksen‚Äôs **wife, [Eline Eriksen](https://dbpedia.org/page/Eline_Eriksen)**, posed instead!\n\nSo, the Little Mermaid you see today is partly inspired by art, love, and family ‚Äî a true Danish creation.\n\n### A Tough Life\n\nEven though she looks peaceful, the Little Mermaid has had a difficult life. Over the years, some people have damaged her many times.\n\n* In **1964**, someone cut off her head!\n* In **1984**, her arm was removed ‚Äî but returned a few days later.\n* In **1998**, her head was stolen again but later found and replaced.\n* In **2003**, she was pushed into the water!\n\nSometimes she is also painted or dressed up during protests. Still, she always comes back ‚Äî strong and smiling again.\n\n### Symbol of Copenhagen\n\nThe Little Mermaid is more than just a statue. She is a **symbol of Copenhagen** ‚Äî just like the **Eiffel Tower** is for Paris or the **Statue of Liberty** is for New York.\n\nShe reminds visitors of Denmark‚Äôs love for art, stories, and the sea. Even though she is small, she has a big place in the hearts of people all around the world.\n\n**Travel Tip:**\nThe best time to visit The Little Mermaid is early in the morning or late in the evening ‚Äî when there are fewer tourists. Bring a jacket (it‚Äôs windy near the water!) and take a quiet moment to enjoy the view of the harbour.\n\n### What‚Äôs Next?\n\nAfter spending some quiet time with the Little Mermaid, we started walking again ‚Äî this time towards Amalienborg Palace, the royal home of the Danish Queen. The beautiful palace square and the changing of the guards were waiting for us!\n\nüëâ Read the next part of our ‚ÄúTrip in Denmark‚Äù series: A Royal Morning at Amalienborg Palace.\n"},{"slug":"from-draculas-castle-to-the-carpathian-mountains","title":"From Dracula's Castle to the Carpathian Mountains: Discovering a New World in Romania","date":"2025-09-11","tags":["romania","culture","travel","east europe"],"coverImage":"/images/romania/16.webp","content":"\nA journey through Romania is like stepping into a storybook, a place where ancient myths live side-by-side with incredible natural beauty. From the misty, legendary castles to the soaring, misty mountains, our trip was an unforgettable adventure for both me and my daughter. We discovered a country that is full of surprises, a place of history, stunning landscapes, and a unique mix of cultures.\n\n### Our Romanian Adventure Begins\n\nOur Romanian story began the moment we landed at Otopeni Airport (OTP). Right there, we picked up our rental car‚Äîa big, comfortable Skoda Kodiaq. It was a 7-seater, perfect for our group: my family from and my friends' family, all traveling together. Having a big car was the best decision, giving us the freedom to explore Romania at our own pace. The car was our little home on wheels for the whole trip.\n\n### Day 1 & 2: The Land of Dracula\n\nOur first destination was the heart of Transylvania, the land famous for vampires and folklore. My childhood memories of playing Dracula games with my cousins came flooding back. Now, as a grown-up, I was here with my daughter, chasing those same stories. It was a journey we both wanted to take, inspired by my old games and her new movies like *Hotel Transylvania*.\n\nOur first stop was Bran Castle, often called \"Dracula's Castle.\" It stands high on a rocky hill, looking just like the kind of place a vampire count would live. The castle is a beautiful, old fortress with tall towers and dark wood. Even though we know that the real Vlad the Impaler, the ruler who inspired the Dracula story, only visited this place and didn't live here, the castle still feels magical. Walking through its narrow stairways and stone rooms, you can almost hear the whispers of history. My daughter and I were in awe of the castle's ancient walls and the amazing views of the green hills all around.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/18.webp)\n![](/images/romania/7.webp)\n![](/images/romania/1.webp)\n![](/images/romania/8.webp)\n![](/images/romania/9.webp)\n![](/images/romania/13.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nFrom Bran, we traveled to Sighi»ôoara, a town that feels like a time machine. Sighi»ôoara is a medieval town, meaning it is very, very old. The streets are made of round stones, and the houses are painted in bright colors like yellow, blue, and red. It's so beautiful that the old town is a UNESCO World Heritage site. This is a very special place because it is the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler.\n\nWe found the very house where he was born in the year 1431. Today, this old house has a restaurant inside. We had a meal there, thinking about how we were sitting in the same place where a famous historical figure once lived.\n\nWe also heard about a special room for tourists, but we were glad we took a chance and decided to go inside. The plan was for my daughter and my friend's daughter to explore the Dracula room upstairs. However, the entrance was already quite scary, with spooky music and dim lighting, and my friend's little daughter got too frightened to go in. So, it was just me and my daughter, ready for the adventure!\n\nWe walked through the entrance, which was decorated with creepy props, and climbed the stairs to the main room. The air felt thick with mystery. In the center of the room, surrounded by other eerie objects, we saw it: a coffin, half-open. My daughter was pushing me to go ahead, a little nervous but also full of excitement. As I moved closer to the coffin, a figure slowly opened its lid. It was Dracula himself, with a pale, long face and the traditional dark clothes. To make the moment more dramatic for my daughter, I pretended to be scared and jumped back with a gasp.\n\nThe actor, still lying in the coffin, must have thought I was truly frightened. He spread out his hand in a gesture of reassurance. I took his hand and gave him a friendly shake. My daughter watched with wide eyes, pulling on my arm and whispering for us to hurry and leave, still a little scared but also fascinated by the whole experience.\n\nAs we walked back down the stairs, she told me that she knew it was a human, but she was still scared. And then she said something that made my heart melt: \"I feel pity for him. It was quite warm in the room!\" In that moment, she wasn't just thinking of a scary vampire; she was thinking of a person doing a job. it was a funny and touching end to our vampire hunt, a memory we will never forget.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/2.webp)\n![](/images/romania/23.webp)\n![](/images/romania/5.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIt was the perfect finale to our day, and we drove back to our hotel, looking forward to the next part of our adventure. The following morning, we set out on the road again.\n\n### Day 3 & 4: The Road to the Sky\n\nAfter the castles and towns, it was time for a change of pace.\n\nOne of the most pleasant parts of our drive was traveling through the small Romanian villages. The scenery changed from the busy city to peaceful country roads. We saw beautiful wooden houses with decorated gates and colorful flowers in every garden. People waved at us, and we waved back. The air was clean and fresh, and we enjoyed seeing the simple, beautiful life of the countryside.\n\nWe drove towards the famous Carpathian Mountains. This mountain range is a big part of Romania, with tall peaks and deep forests. We took a special road called the TransfƒÉgƒÉrƒÉ»ôan Highway. People call it \"the Road to the Sky\" because it climbs up and up, winding its way through the mountains.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/15.webp)\n![](/images/romania/12.webp)\n![](/images/romania/3.webp)\n![](/images/romania/6.webp)\n![](/images/romania/22.webp)\n![](/images/romania/24.webp)\n![](/images/romania/20.webp)\n![](/images/romania/17.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe TransfƒÉgƒÉrƒÉ»ôan is not just a road; it's an adventure. It has many twists and turns, like a long snake. The views from the car window were breathtaking. We saw thick forests, rocky cliffs, and waterfalls. This road was built a long time ago by a Romanian leader. It is so high up that it is only open in the summer months when there is no snow. Driving this road felt like being on top of the world.\n\nOur mountain adventure continued with a hike. We started at a beautiful place called B√¢lea Lake. From there, we walked to another lake, Lake Capra. The weather was not sunny and clear; it was foggy and misty, and it started to rain. At first, we were a little sad, thinking we wouldn't see much. But the fog and rain made the hike even more special.\n\nThe mountains looked like a mystery, with the fog hiding the tops of the peaks. The path was slippery, and we had to be careful with every step. The air was cool and fresh. The sounds of the rain and the wind were all we could hear. This hike taught us that nature's beauty can be found even on a rainy day. It wasn't about seeing everything from a distance; it was about feeling the mountain's power and being part of its wild beauty.\n\n### A Mix of Worlds\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7k3Ao8nq2I\n\nAs we drove back from the mountains, we saw more of Romania. One thing that was surprising was the traffic in the big cities. It was busy and a little crazy, reminding me of some cities in Asia. This mix of cultures and styles is what makes Romania so unique‚Äîit feels like a bridge between different parts of the world.\n\nWe also noticed many churches. In villages and cities, and even on the side of country roads, we saw small crosses and statues of Christ. It showed us how important faith is to the people here.\n\nAnd of course, we had to try the food! We ate many nice meals. And for a special treat, we enjoyed a fizzy Coke, which tasted even better after our long drives and hikes. Sometimes the places were a bit crowded with other people, but that just showed how many people love this country.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/romania/21.webp)\n![](/images/romania/19.webp)\n![](/images/romania/11.webp)\n![](/images/romania/10.webp)\n![](/images/romania/14.webp)\n![](/images/romania/25.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nOur trip to Romania was a mix of everything: the old stories of vampires and the real history of rulers, the beauty of the TransfƒÉgƒÉrƒÉ»ôan road, and the peaceful, misty mountains. It was a journey that went beyond just visiting places; it was a journey into a country's heart, a place of magic, history, and nature's amazing power. We left with our minds full of beautiful pictures and our hearts full of wonderful memories.\n"},{"slug":"your-next-adventure-uncover-swedens-greatest-secret","title":"Your Next Adventure: Uncover Sweden's Greatest Secret","date":"2025-09-09","tags":["sweden","viking","archaeology","history"],"coverImage":"/images/uppakra/2.webp","author":"","content":"\nHave you ever wanted to travel back in time? To walk where Vikings and powerful chiefs once lived? In Sweden, just a short drive from the city of Lund, there is a special place called Upp√•kra. It's not a big castle or a museum with many buildings. It is a big, empty field. But don't let that fool you! Under this field lies the history of an ancient city, waiting to be discovered.\n\nA long time ago, Upp√•kra was a very important city. It was bigger than many other Viking towns. For more than 1,000 years, people lived here. They built homes, made beautiful jewelry, and traded with people from far away, even the Roman Empire! This place was a center of power, religion, and trade.\n\n## What Makes Upp√•kra So Special?\n\nArchaeologists have found so many amazing things here. Over 50,000 objects made of gold, silver, and other materials have been pulled from the ground. Imagine walking over a field and knowing that a king's golden helmet or a beautiful silver goblet is buried just below your feet!\n\nOne of the most exciting finds was a Cult House. This was a special building where people gathered to pray to their gods. It was a very tall house for its time and had strong wooden pillars. They even found a rare glass bowl and a bronze cup, likely used in special ceremonies.\n\nUnder the ground, there are also remains of a large longhouse, where the chief and his family likely lived. They've found things like tools, pottery, and even instruments used for surgery! This shows that the people of Upp√•kra were very smart and skilled.\n\n## An Adventure for You!\n\nUpp√•kra is a different kind of adventure. Instead of seeing old buildings, you get to imagine them. It's a place that makes you think about history and how people lived so long ago. As you walk across the fields, you're walking on top of history. It's like a giant puzzle, and every new discovery adds a new piece.\n\nYou can visit Upp√•kra on your own, or you can join a guided tour in the summer. The guides will tell you all the stories about the kings, warriors, and everyday people who lived here. You can even see the places where the different houses and workshops once stood.\n\n## A Little Bit of Mystery\n\nWhy did such a powerful city suddenly disappear? The city of Lund was founded nearby in the late 900s. People believe that the king wanted to move the power center and bring Christianity to the area. So, the people of Upp√•kra were likely told to move to the new city. Upp√•kra became just a small village, and its glory was forgotten for a very long time.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Upp√•kra house model](/images/uppakra/1.webp)\n![Upp√•kra Church next to the site](/images/uppakra/3.webp)\n![Upp√•kra](/images/uppakra/4.webp)\n![Archaeological excavation site of Upp√•kra](/images/uppakra/5.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nUpp√•kra is still a place of mystery. Only a tiny part of the area has been dug up and explored. This means that a lot of history is still hidden underground, just waiting for the next discovery. If you love history, archaeology, and a bit of adventure, Upp√•kra is a perfect place to visit. It will surely make you curious about the stories from the past.\n"},{"slug":"unlocking-the-secrets-of-swedens-hidden-stone-ships","title":"Stonehenge? Think Smaller! Unlocking the Secrets of Sweden's Hidden Stone Ships","date":"2025-08-29","tags":["sweden","scandinavia","viking","history"],"coverImage":"/images/ap/9.webp","content":"\nThe air was fresh, and the sun was bright as we made our way to [Ales Stenar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/twyjSJev5gLuZttV8). This place is one of southern Sweden's most historic spots, a hidden gem that feels a world away from everything. It has the same kind of mystery as England's Stonehenge but without the big crowds and gift shops.\n\nThe journey itself was a treat. We traveled through the rolling, green landscape of Sk√•ne, a region known for its beauty. As we got closer to the coast, we started to see colorful shapes floating in the sky‚Äîparagliders riding the wind, looking like birds soaring over the sea. When we finally arrived, the view was breathtaking. The stones are on a grassy hill right by the sea, with a perfect view of the water and the coastline.\n\nI just stood there for a moment, looking at the huge stones lined up like a giant ship. It's easy to see why this spot is so special. You can feel the history and the mystery in the air.\n\nThe modern world wasn't completely gone, though. While I was lost in thought, a few paragliders drifted lazily overhead, their bright parachutes a perfect contrast to the ancient, grey stones below. They looked so peaceful, floating silently over the land and sea, almost like modern-day explorers discovering the same amazing view.\n\n## Sweden's Stone Ships: A Tale of Mysteries\n\nLooking at these giant rocks, you can't help but wonder: Why are they here? What did they mean to the people who built them so long ago?\n\nBut what if I told you that Ales Stenar isn't the only monument like this in the area? Not far away lies another, equally mysterious site: the stone ship at S Ugglarp.\n\nImagine a second ship, this one with 39 upright stones, stretching 45 meters long. Just like with Ales Stenar, this site raises all kinds of questions. Who were the people who moved these huge stones? Why did they build two of these monuments? What connects these two incredible places?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YU4wGUvQdbM\n\nThis second stone ship adds a whole new layer to the mystery. It‚Äôs a powerful reminder that these monuments weren't just a one-time thing; they were part of a bigger culture and tradition.\n\nBut here‚Äôs the most curious part: Ales Stenar has 59 stones, and the one at S Ugglarp has 39. Are these just random numbers, or do they mean something special? In ancient cultures, numbers often had a deeper, spiritual meaning. Could these numbers represent something lost to time? A specific number of days, a certain constellation, or even a story we no longer know?\n\nThis difference makes the mystery even deeper. It suggests that while the stone ships served a similar purpose, there was something unique about each one.\n\n## Uncovering the Theories\n\nEven though no one knows for sure, there are many interesting ideas about what these stone ships were used for. These ideas show us how curious people have been for centuries.\n\n### A Viking Burial Site\n\nOne of the most popular theories is that these were [burial monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_funeral). People from the [Viking Age](https://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/prehistoric-period-until-1050-ad/the-viking-age/) often buried important people in \"stone ships,\" which were thought to help guide the dead on their final journey. This is a powerful idea, especially since archaeologists have sometimes found graves with burned bones from the Late Iron Age inside similar monuments. However, a full grave has never been found at Ales Stenar, so the mystery remains.\n\n### A Giant Sundial\n\nAnother fascinating theory is that the stones are a [solar calendar](https://www.britannica.com/science/solar-calendar) or a giant sundial. The stones at Ales Stenar are placed in a way that the sun sets at the northwestern tip of the ship in the summer and rises at the opposite end in the winter. This alignment with the seasons suggests that the people who built it had deep knowledge of the sun and stars. Maybe it was a way for them to keep track of time and important events.\n\n### A Place for Ceremonies\n\nSome experts believe these stone ships were ceremonial sites or places for special gatherings. Their amazing location would have made them perfect spots for rituals or important meetings. The stones could have marked a place of power, where people came together to celebrate or honor their leaders.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/ap/2.webp)\n![](/images/ap/3.webp)\n![](/images/ap/4.webp)\n![](/images/ap/5.webp)\n![](/images/ap/6.webp)\n![](/images/ap/7.webp)\n![](/images/ap/8.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nNo matter the true reason, these sites are a reminder of how much we still have to learn about the past. They‚Äôre places that make you think about ancient people and their beliefs, and they show that the wonders of the world can be found in the most unexpected places. Even today, people are drawn to these special sites, whether it's to walk among the stones or to fly over them.\n\nHave you ever visited a historical place that made you feel like you were solving a mystery?\n"},{"slug":"we-found-nemo-and-dory-at-northern-europes-largest-aquarium","title":"We Found Nemo (and Dory!) at Northern Europe‚Äôs Largest Aquarium","date":"2025-08-22","tags":["travel","culture","denmark","scandinavia"],"coverImage":"/images/blue_planet/16.webp","content":"To celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 7th birthday, we wanted to do something truly unforgettable ‚Äî something that would open her eyes to the wonders of the world beneath the sea. Just a few metres from the √òresund strait in Copenhagen sits a place that does exactly that: Den Bl√• Planet, the National Aquarium of Denmark. This is Northern Europe‚Äôs largest, most state-of-the-art aquarium, and it offers not only an impressive collection of marine life, but also a full sensory journey into the mysteries of the ocean.\n\n## First Impressions ‚Äì A Building Like a Whirlpool\n\nFrom the outside, Den Bl√• Planet immediately captures your attention. Its architecture is inspired by the swirling motion of a whirlpool ‚Äî sleek curves of steel and glass that almost appear to be in motion themselves. Walking toward the entrance, you already feel like you‚Äôre being pulled into another world.\n\nOnce inside, guests step straight into the ‚Äúvortex‚Äù ‚Äî a curved lobby that branches into the aquarium‚Äôs three main sections. From here, you‚Äôre drawn into a labyrinth of 53 aquariums and installations holding more than seven million liters of water, home to thousands of animals from around the globe.\n\n## Getting In ‚Äì Skipping the Line but Not the Wait\n\nWe had purchased our tickets online, which meant we could skip the ticket counter. However, Den Bl√• Planet controls visitor numbers carefully to ensure that each guest has the best possible experience. This meant we waited about half an hour at the entrance before being allowed inside. It was a small inconvenience, but once we stepped in, the wait was well worth it.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Alligator gar](/images/blue_planet/6.webp)\n![The big Aquarium](/images/blue_planet/9.webp)\n![Shark](/images/blue_planet/2.webp)\n![Bioluminescent corais macios](/images/blue_planet/11.webp)\n![Stingray](/images/blue_planet/7.webp)\n![Xingu River ray](/images/blue_planet/10.webp)\n![Nemo is looking at us!](/images/blue_planet/1.webp)\n![Seahorse](/images/blue_planet/3.webp)\n![The Golden Poison Frog](/images/blue_planet/5.webp)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/8.webp)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/12.webp)\n![Sharks](/images/blue_planet/18.webp)\n![Red-bellied piranha](/images/blue_planet/13.webp)\n![Dory!

Digital screens provide detailed information about the animals, and with the press of a button, you can switch between Danish and English.\n\nThroughout the day, there are scheduled activities and live feedings. One of the highlights for me was watching the piranha feeding ‚Äî equal parts thrilling and educational.\nTo make sure everyone, especially children, has a chance to enjoy the exhibits, Den Bl√• Planet has marked viewing spots in front of the larger tanks. Families can stand there without blocking others, and kids can enjoy an unobstructed view of the marine life. It‚Äôs a thoughtful detail that makes the visit more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n## Tropical Rainforest ‚Äì A Living Jungle\n\nOne of the most surprising and delightful areas was the tropical rainforest section. It felt like stepping into a miniature jungle: warm air, lush greenery, and the sounds of exotic creatures. Tiny frogs hopped across the pathways, so you had to watch your step carefully. My daughter loved this part, giggling every time she spotted a frog hiding among the leaves. The rainforest also includes other fascinating species, offering a glimpse into ecosystems beyond the ocean.\n\n## The Shark Tunnel ‚Äì Walking Beneath the Waves\n\nThe true showstopper, however, was the shark tunnel. Imagine walking through a long glass corridor while sharks, giant stingrays, and sea turtles glide gracefully above and around you. The sheer size of the tank makes you feel as if you‚Äôve shrunk and stepped right into the ocean. For children ‚Äî and adults too ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mesmerizing experience, one that inspires both awe and respect for marine life.\n\n## Interactive Fun for Kids\n\nDen Bl√• Planet isn‚Äôt just about looking ‚Äî it‚Äôs about experiencing. There are touch pools where children (under staff supervision) can gently interact with marine animals. For a 7-year-old birthday girl, this was a dream come true ‚Äî she got to feel the texture of sea stars and other fascinating creatures, making the day even more special.\nPractical Information ‚Äì Planning Your Visit\nDen Bl√• Planet is open 365 days a year, including holidays:\n\n- Monday: 10 am ‚Äì 9 pm\n- Tuesday ‚Äì Sunday: 10 am ‚Äì 5 pm\n- Saturdays (annual pass holders): 9 am ‚Äì 10 am early entry\n- Peak seasons: daily 10 am ‚Äì 9 pm\n\nThe building itself covers 10,000 m¬≤ indoors with an additional 2,000 m¬≤ outdoor area plus parking facilities, so there‚Äôs plenty of space to explore.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJY5hgfYkcg\n\n## A Day to Remember\n\nThere are impressive aquariums all over the world, but Den Bl√• Planet truly stands out for its combination of architecture, atmosphere, and attention to detail. Whether spotting Nemo and Dory or walking through the mesmerizing shark tunnel, the aquarium offers an unforgettable glimpse into the mysteries of the sea.\n\nIf you find yourself in Copenhagen, this is an attraction you shouldn‚Äôt miss. For us, it wasn‚Äôt just a day at the aquarium ‚Äî it was an adventure, a birthday gift of wonder and discovery that my daughter (and all of us) will never forget.\n"},{"slug":"swedish-museum-that-makes-kids-smarter-and-adults-amazed","title":"The Swedish Museum That Makes Kids Smarter and Adults Amazed","date":"2025-08-16","tags":["sweden","stockholm","travel","culture"],"coverImage":"/images/nhms/IMG_3971.webp","author":"","content":"\nWhen I first walked into the **Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet** in Stockholm, I felt like I had just opened a giant storybook about our planet.

No ‚Äì here you can spend *days* if you really want to explore every single corner.\n\nThe museum is full of different worlds:\n\n* Dinosaurs towering above me, their bones showing the power of life long gone.\n* Shiny gems and colorful stones that looked like treasures from a fairy tale.\n* Animals from every part of Earth ‚Äì from deep oceans to frozen Arctic lands.\n* A whole section about humans and how we evolved, explained in such a clear way that even kids could tell the story back to you.\n\nAt one point, my daughter started *teaching me* about fossils and animals. That is the magic of this place ‚Äì children don‚Äôt just watch, they explore and learn, and they do it with joy.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Dinosaurs Eggs](/images/nhms/IMG_3976.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3947.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3949.webp)\n![Dinosaurs](/images/nhms/IMG_3974.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3975.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3981.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3985.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3986.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3987.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3989.webp)\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3999.webp)\n![Pre-Historic Rhinoceroses fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4005.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Don‚Äôt Miss These Highlights\n\nEvery part of the museum is special, but there are a few experiences that you should not miss:\n\n* **Cosmonova Dome Cinema** ‚Äì Imagine sitting inside a giant half-globe where the movie surrounds you. One moment you are flying through space, the next you are diving under the sea. It feels so real that you almost forget you are in a chair.\n* **The Dinosaur Hall** ‚Äì These ancient giants are always a favorite. Standing next to a dinosaur skeleton makes you feel very small.\n* **The Human Journey** ‚Äì Walk step by step through how humans came to be. It‚Äôs like traveling back in time.\n* **Swedish Nature** ‚Äì A beautiful exhibit that shows forests, lakes, animals, and birds from Sweden. It feels like being outside in nature, but indoors.\n* **Fossils and Gems** ‚Äì Some sparkle, some look strange, but every stone tells a story millions of years old.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![The Giant Puffball](/images/nhms/IMG_3923.webp)\n![5kg Lobster](/images/nhms/IMG_3926.webp)\n![The Giant Crab](/images/nhms/IMG_3929.webp)\n![The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3934.webp)\n![My Daughter in front of The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3933.webp)\n![Iron meteorite](/images/nhms/IMG_3936.webp)\n![Cross section of a Gigantic tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3952.webp)\n![Human Evolution Tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3995.webp)\n![Neanderthals](/images/nhms/IMG_4006.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## A Living Classroom\n\nWhat makes this museum stand out is how interactive it is. It is not just about looking ‚Äì you can touch, listen, and explore. There are screens where you can read more, buttons to press, and activities for kids.\n\nIt honestly felt like a mix of school, play, and magic. My wife who studied biological science said it was like revisiting our university lessons, but in a fun way. That shows how much detail the museum gives ‚Äì simple enough for kids, deep enough for adults.\n\n## Tips for Your Visit\n\nHere are some things I learned that will make your visit even better:\n\n* **Take your time.** The museum is huge. Plan at least 3‚Äì4 hours, or even more if you include Cosmonova.\n* **Book Cosmonova early.** Shows are popular, and each one takes time.\n* **Bring your own food.** The restaurant *Fossilen* is there, but I liked the calm seating area near the lockers. You can warm food in the microwave and enjoy your meal in peace.\n* **Dress light.** Inside it gets quite warm, even on cold days outside.\n* **Buy tickets online.** This saves you from standing in queues.\n* **Parking is easy.** The cheaper option is by the apartment buildings ‚Äì only 50kr for the whole day.\n* **Perfect for rainy days.** The museum is all indoors, so it‚Äôs a cozy adventure.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3937.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3939.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3943.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3979.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3982.webp)\n![Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet](/images/nhms/IMG_3909.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## As we finish\n\nWhen I left the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, I felt like I had traveled through time, from the age of dinosaurs to the mysteries of space. This is not just a museum ‚Äì it‚Äôs a living adventure.\n\nIf you are in Stockholm, **don‚Äôt miss it**. Whether you are with kids, friends, or even alone, you will come out with new knowledge, fun memories, and maybe even more questions about our amazing world.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4002.webp)\n![Underwater Life](/images/nhms/IMG_4013.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3983.webp)\n\n<!--gallery-->\n"},{"slug":"journey-to-catch-the-northern-lights-beyond-the-arctic-circle","title":"Under the Blue Hole: Our Journey to Catch the Northern Lights Beyond the Arctic Circle","date":"2025-08-15","tags":["scandinavia","sweden","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/winterabisko/IMG_4251.webp","content":"At the end of 2022, we had to renew our passports.\nFrom the quiet south of Sweden, we set our eyes on Stockholm, where the embassy waited. It would be a long, slow journey by train ‚Äî six hours of rails stretching through frost and distance.\n\nBut winter has its own way of whispering temptations, and we listened.\nIf we were already traveling north, why not keep going? Why not continue past cities and forests, past the comfort of the familiar, to a place where the earth tilts toward the sky ‚Äî Abisko, far beyond the Arctic Circle, seventeen hours by train from Stockholm.\n\nAfter the embassy appointment, we boarded the night train on the 29th of November, just after six in the evening. We had booked a sleeper cabin: warm, tidy, with a shower, thick blankets, and the comforting sense that the night would belong entirely to us. Our luggage was heavy with winter clothing; the forecasts spoke of -15¬∞C.\n\nWe slept early, and so we woke early.\n\nIn the darkness, I pulled up the blind from the window. The world outside was not the one we had left. The train slid silently through a kingdom of white ‚Äî frozen lakes, glassy rivers, mountains dressed in snow, and forests stripped bare except for the stubborn pines. Coming from a warm South Asian country, we had never seen such a thing: a landscape so still and pale it could have been another planet. We remained by the window, unwilling to close our eyes again, watching the ghostly scenery until the train whispered into Abisko around noon.\n\nIt was the 30th of November.\n\nAbisko is a small village in the shadow of Sweden‚Äôs mining town, Kiruna, and the mountains that cradle it. Only one grocery store stands here, its windows glowing faintly in the Polar Night ‚Äî for in winter, the sun never rises above the horizon.\n\nAbisko is more than a village. It is a place of study, where scientists from around the world gather to measure the breath of the Arctic. Since 1913, the Abisko Scientific Research Station has recorded the winds, the snow, the slow thawing of permafrost. It is also a place where the sky holds a secret: a microclimate, the *blue hole*, which grants clearer skies than most of the Arctic. And in those skies, when the clouds part, the Northern Lights appear.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Abisko Central Station](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4027.webp)\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2141.webp)\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4031.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nOur hotel was a fifteen-minute walk from the station, along an icy road that shimmered under the dim light. We settled in, cooked simple meals from our grocery bags, played with our daughter in the snow, and wandered to the frozen lake to feel the silence.\n\nOn December 1st, we set out on the Nissunj√•kka Suspension Bridge trail ‚Äî 8.4 kilometers through birch forests and along the Abiskojokk River, the air so sharp it seemed to cut sound itself. There were moments when we were the only living souls in sight. Three and a half hours later, we returned to the hotel under a sky that refused to turn day. That night, we walked again toward the lake, hoping the heavens might open ‚Äî but the clouds remained, and the sky kept its secret.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4167.webp)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4180.webp)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_1881.webp)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4206.webp)\n![slipped in icy river](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4155.webp)\n![mountains and lake](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4354.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next day, we traced another path: the √ñstra Loop Trail, 11.3 kilometers of snow, river, and canyon. Words cannot hold the beauty of Abisko in winter; it is not something seen but something breathed. Still, the sky stayed veiled, and we began to think ourselves unlucky.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4301.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4292.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4290.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4280.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4300.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2095.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIt was my wife who suggested the chase.\nThe hotel organized nightly journeys for those unwilling to leave without seeing the aurora. That night, December 2nd, at nine o‚Äôclock, we boarded one of three small buses with travelers from across the world. Our guide was from Argentina, now a man of the north, and we spoke of Maradona and the mad devotion of Bangladesh to football.\n\nThe chase was a patient game. We drove from valley to ridge, from frozen road to silent clearing, looking for a patch of sky with fewer clouds. Finally, the guide stopped and stepped out into the freezing night. Coffee and warm lingonberry juice were passed around. We waited. The cold sank into our bones.\n\nThen ‚Äî a shout.\n\nWe looked up. At first, we saw nothing but the night. The guide told us to keep looking, to let our eyes learn. Slowly, faint grains of light gathered overhead, as if someone were sifting silver dust across the heavens. The shapes thickened, spread, twisted. The sky began to move. Green ribbons unfurled, curling and folding like smoke in a wind only the stars could feel. Light danced from one edge of the horizon to the other, fading in one place as it flared in another.\n\nIt lasted perhaps twenty minutes, perhaps forever.\n\nWe stood there, strangers bound together by awe, each of us quietly aware that we were inside a memory we would never lose. I had seen the aurora later, from the backyard of our home in southern Sweden, but never like this ‚Äî in the deep of the Arctic night, with the whole sky breathing above us.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4029.webp)\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2120.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next morning, we began the long journey south. The light we had chased stayed with us, a flicker behind the eyes, as if some part of the north had followed us home.\n"},{"slug":"the-brutally-honest-guide-to-getting-a-swedish-driving-license","title":"The Brutally Honest Guide to Getting a Swedish Driving License (Without Going Broke or Losing Your Mind)","date":"2025-08-14","tags":["sweden","driving","life","tips"],"coverImage":"/images/driving_license/4q8l084q8l084q8l.webp","author":"","content":"\nObtaining a driving license in Sweden is quite a challenging process ‚Äî both mentally and financially.\n\nThe country has clearly defined standards and checkpoints that you must meet to pass. It is mentally demanding because instructors and examiners may fail you for even a small deviation from those standards. For example, when turning right, if you check the rear-view mirror and right mirror but forget to check your right-side blind spot, you will fail.\n\n## Financial Reality\n\nFor many Swedes, the process is easier financially. They often get support from their parents, who can act as instructors and provide a car for practice. Before taking the real exam, they may have 100‚Äì500 hours of driving practice. Statistically, it is said that you need at least 200 hours of driving to develop strong muscle memory.\n\nFor newcomers like me, it‚Äôs even more frustrating. We may not know the Swedish language or culture, and even if we already have a license from another country, our driving style may be seen as aggressive here. In many cases, we must relearn driving entirely according to Swedish standards.\n\nIf you rely fully on driving schools, money becomes a major factor. One lesson costs around 1,200 SEK for 80 minutes (at the time of this writing). To reach 200 hours through a school, you‚Äôd need around 150 lessons ‚Äî costing about **180,000 SEK**.\n\nIn practice, if you have prior driving experience, you might need a minimum 30‚Äì40 lessons (around 48,000 SEK). For complete beginners 40-100 lessons, costs can easily reach 100,000 SEK. If you plan to rely entirely on a driving school, save this money beforehand based on your situation. Pausing midway and resuming later often means retaking many lessons.\n\n## Time Commitment\n\nTime is another key factor. You‚Äôll need to dedicate time for studying, dealing with frustration, and even walking around to learn local roads and traffic conditions. If you‚Äôre already stressed, pursuing a license will feel much harder.\n\nIdeally, set aside **2‚Äì4 months** to focus on your driving license as a top priority during that period.\n\n**Seasonal tip:** Plan your entire activity so that your practical exam falls around **July or August**. For example:\n\n- March: Begin the process and apply for your learner‚Äôs permit.\n- April: Finish reading the theory book.\n- April‚ÄìMay: Focus on theory studies.\n- May‚ÄìJuly: Practical driving lessons.\n- July‚ÄìAugust: Take your practical exam.\n\nThis plan gives you long daylight hours for practice, which is much easier than learning in winter darkness.\n\n## Sweden‚Äôs Road Safety Approach\n\nSweden aims to minimize accidents and fatalities through strict standards and defensive driving principles. Drivers are expected to anticipate potential hazards and act appropriately in any situation. A driving license may offer freedom, but it comes with serious responsibility.\n\nUnderstanding the [**standard checkpoints**](https://trafikverket.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1389795/FULLTEXT04.pdf) before your exam is critical. I highly recommend reading [this free online theory book](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/K%C3%B6rkortonline_se_Theory_Book_Driving_Licence_Book?id=PzWxEAAAQBAJ) to get a solid grasp of what Transportstyrelsen expects from drivers. I even recommend it to city cyclists and predistrans.\n\n## Steps to Get a Driving License in Sweden (B-Type)\n\n> All the following information applies to a **B-type driving license**.\n\n### 1. Eye Test\n\nMake sure your vision meets the requirements. Visit any optician and request an eye exam for a driving license. The optician will send the results directly to Transportstyrelsen. This usually costs 100‚Äì150 SEK.\n\n### 2. Learner‚Äôs Permit\n\nOnce your eye test is approved, you can apply for a learner‚Äôs permit.\n\n### 3. Risk Training\n\n**Risk 1 (Riskettan)**\nA theoretical course covering alcohol, drugs, fatigue, and other risky behaviors that impair driving. Cost: 400‚Äì1,100 SEK.\n\n**Risk 2 (Halkbana)**\nA practical course that teaches handling dangerous situations, especially skidding on slippery roads ‚Äî common in Nordic winters. Cost: 2,000‚Äì3,000 SEK.\n\nBoth Risk 1 and Risk 2 are valid for **five years**. You can search for [authorised instructors offering risk courses here](https://lisutb-p.transportstyrelsen.se/extweb/#/).\n\n### 4. Theory Study\n\nCovers traffic rules, signs, safety, vehicle knowledge, and eco-driving.\n\n- Course cost: 400‚Äì1,500 SEK (depending on provider).\n- 70 multiple-choice questions (5 are trial questions and don‚Äôt count).\n- Passing score: 52 correct answers.\n- Duration: 50 minutes.\n- Theory test cost: 420‚Äì520 SEK.\n- Pass is valid for **four months**.\n\nThere are many online theory practice tools ‚Äî choose one that suits you. You can study through a driving school, but it‚Äôs not mandatory.\n\n**Tip:** Alternate theory study with practical lessons to reinforce learning.\n\n### 5. Practical Lessons\n\nYou can train at a driving school, with a private instructor, or both. Private practice requires an [introductory course with your supervising driver at an approved school](https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/en/road/driving-licences/permits-for-driving-training/).\n\nSince lessons are expensive, book them when you are calm and focused. Have at least a one-hour buffer before and after each lesson to avoid stress.\n\nStick to one instructor if possible. Changing schools often disrupts progress and costs more in the long run.\n\n### 6. Practical Exam\n\n- Cost: 1,000‚Äì1,400 SEK.\n- Best time slots: ***09:30*** ‚Äì***11:00*** or ***13:30*** ‚Äì***15:30*** for lighter traffic.\n- Aim for summer months when roads are quieter and weather is favorable.\n- It matters where you practice and where you book your exam. Target the practical exam center first, then focus your practice in that city. This way, you‚Äôll become familiar with local roads, traffic patterns, and common challenges in that area. Generally, the quieter the city, the higher your chances of passing the exam on the first try.\n\n## Cheaper Alternatives\n\n- If you‚Äôve been a Swedish resident for less than a year and have a valid non-EEA license, you can drive for one year. During this time, buy a cheap car, practice, study theory, take some lessons, and then book your test.\n- Some people swap licenses in another country first (e.g., Denmark) and then exchange them for a Swedish license ‚Äî if their original license is swappable there.\n\n## Foreign Driving Licenses in Sweden\n\n- **Non-EEA licenses**: Valid for 1 year after becoming a Swedish resident. After that, you must pass the Swedish tests.\n- **EEA licenses**: Valid until expiry. You can also swap them for a Swedish license.\n\n## Summing up\n\n![Swedish Driving License Checklist](/images/driving_license/sweden_driving_license_checklist.webp)\n\nThe two most important factors are **time** and **money**. Set aside the full budget so you don‚Äôt have to stop midway, and dedicate 3‚Äì5 months of focused effort. The rest is discipline, patience, and persistence.\n\nIf you think I‚Äôve missed something or have experiences of your own to share, feel free to leave a comment below. Your insight might help others who are on the same journey.\n"},{"slug":"from-forest-trails-to-glaciers-our-most-unforgettable-week-in-norway","title":"From Forest Trails to Glaciers: Our Most Unforgettable Week in Norway","date":"2025-08-06","tags":["scandinavia","itinerary","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/norway2025/1.webp","content":"\nYou know that smart idea you have when you‚Äôre already tired? That‚Äôs how this trip started.\n\nWe had just finished moving apartments ‚Äî in the middle of summer, sweating like we were in a gym we didn‚Äôt sign up for. Our backs ached, our muscles felt like jelly, and the idea of packing again for a vacation sounded like punishment.\n\nBut then‚Ä¶ the little voice in my head went, ‚ÄúYou know what you need? A road trip.‚Äù\n\nAnd not just any road trip ‚Äî a 7-day drive through central and western Norway. Because obviously, the cure for exhaustion is‚Ä¶ more exhaustion.\n\n## The Drone Plan\n\nTo spice things up, we bought a drone. Not the toy kind ‚Äî the one that makes you feel like a movie director.\n\nOf course, in Europe, you can‚Äôt just fly a drone wherever you want unless you like paying fines the size of a small car. So the week before the trip, I was cramming drone pilot courses like a college student before finals.\n\nBy the time we left, I had my EU license, the drone was charged, and I was ready to terrorize seagulls across Norway.\n\n## Setting the Route\n\nWe had 7 days. 2 would disappear in just getting from Sweden to Norway and back. That left 5 days to:\n\n- Drive scenic roads\n- See waterfalls, fjords, and glaciers\n- Take more drone shots than a human should\n\nOne driver, one rest day in the middle, and one big rule: the trip‚Äôs mission was to touch a glacier.\n\nTrollstigen ‚Äî the legendary mountain road ‚Äî had just opened for the season, so it became our farthest point before turning back. But the real prize was B√∏yabreen Glacier in Fj√¶rland.\n\nThe route looked like this:\nOslo ‚Üí Trollstigen ‚Üí Geiranger ‚Üí B√∏yabreen Glacier, Fj√¶rland ‚Üí Fl√•m ‚Üí Oslo\n\n## Packing Like a Doomsday Prepper\n\nNorway is beautiful, but if you shop there too much, your wallet starts crying. So we packed like we were going on an Arctic survival mission:\n\n- Portable stove & gas cans\n- Canned food, protein bars, fruit, nuts\n- Coffee & tea (because you don‚Äôt mess with caffeine supply)\n\nThe plan was simple ‚Äî cook in scenic spots, avoid overpriced restaurants, and stay away from big cities as much as possible.\n\n## Day 1 ‚Äì Sweden ‚Üí Oslo\n\nThe morning of 19th July was golden and warm, with that gentle breeze that makes you think the world‚Äôs in a good mood. We left at 9 a.m., windows down, music up, and the back of the car rattling with camping gear.\n\nAbout two hours in, we pulled over at a rest stop ‚Äî one of those quiet roadside spots where the only sound is the wind in the trees and the occasional truck rumbling past. We unpacked the stove, chopped up some vegetables, and fried them in the open air. The smell of sizzling onions mixed with pine trees and hot asphalt ‚Äî oddly comforting.\n\nWhile lunch was cooking, I unpacked the drone. The first flight was shaky, my fingers a little clumsy, but within minutes I was zipping it over the tree line, watching the tiny live feed of endless forest.\n\nBy late afternoon, Oslo‚Äôs skyline appeared. My wife‚Äôs friend met us at the door with that big smile only old friends give you. Inside, the smell of Bangladeshi spices hit me first ‚Äî warm, homey, like a hug for your stomach. We ate until we couldn‚Äôt move.\n\n## Day 2 ‚Äì Oslo ‚Üí Lesjaskogsvatnet Camping\n\nWe rolled out of Oslo around 10 a.m., our trusty volvo v60 humming along narrow roads lined with red-painted houses..\n\nFirst stop was Ringebu Stave Church. The wooden walls were the color of dark honey, weathered by centuries of wind and snow. Inside, the air smelled of dry wood and history. You could almost hear the shuffle of boots from hundreds of years ago.\n\nNext was Myfallet Waterfall. The road there narrowed into something that looked like a driveway, ending in a barrier. We hiked through a forest so green it looked fake, the air heavy with the smell of wet leaves. The waterfall roared in the distance before we even saw it.\n\nWe couldn‚Äôt resist ‚Äî we waded into the river. The water was cool and sharp, the kind that makes you gasp at first but then feels perfect on a warm summer day.\n\nBy then, we were too tired for our third planned stop. We headed straight to Lesjaskogsvatnet Camping, a lake so still it reflected the mountains like a mirror. The only sound was the soft slap of water against the shore. That evening, we flew the drone as the sky turned orange, the lake glowing like molten gold.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Ringebu Stave Church](/images/norway2025/DJI_0019.webp)\n![Myfallet](/images/norway2025/DJI_0029.webp)\n![Lesjaskogsvatnet Lake](/images/norway2025/DJI_0030.webp)\n![Mya River](/images/norway2025/myfallet.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 3 ‚Äì Trollstigen & Geiranger\n\nWe started early.\n\nTrollstigen is not just a road ‚Äî it‚Äôs a dare. Eleven hairpin bends, a 10% incline, and cliffs so steep you wonder if the guardrails are just decorative. Waterfalls burst out of the rock on both sides.\n\nFrom the top, Trollstigen looked unreal ‚Äî a silver ribbon curling down the mountainside in eleven tight bends. We sent the drone gliding over the valley, capturing the tiny cars far below, the waterfalls crashing down beside them, and the still blue lake above, quietly feeding all that power.\n\nBy midday, we reached Geiranger. The fjord was glassy blue, framed by cliffs and waterfalls with names like ‚ÄúSeven Sisters‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Bridal Veil.‚Äù Unfortunately, it was also packed with tourists ‚Äî cruise ships, buses, and people everywhere. The smell of sunscreen and fried food floated in the warm air. We didn‚Äôt linger.\n\nWe ended the day at Djupvatnet Lake, high in the mountains. The air was thin and cool, the water so clear it was like looking into another world. The drone footage here is a Chef‚Äôs kiss.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Geirangerfjord](/images/norway2025/gei_01.webp)\n![Seven Sisters Waterfall](/images/norway2025/gei_02.webp)\n![Geirangerfjord](/images/norway2025/gei_03.webp)\n![Trollstigen road](/images/norway2025/trolls_1.webp)\n![Trollstigen](/images/norway2025/trolls_2.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 4 ‚Äì Sunnfjord: The Lake, The Fish, The Waterfall\n\nThis was supposed to be a lazy day. Just 122 km.\n\nWe reached our cottage by early afternoon ‚Äî and our jaws dropped. On two sides: mountains. On another: a crystal-clear lake, greenish-blue, so calm it felt wrong to disturb it, and in front of us: a roaring waterfall straight from the glacier.\n\nWe dumped our bags and ran straight into the lake water. It was cold enough to make my chest tighten ‚Äî but then came the tickling. Fish, tiny and curious, nibbling at our toes. Nature‚Äôs spa treatment.\n\nLater, we took the canoe out. Every stroke of the paddle sent ripples across the mirrored surface, mountains and sky bending and breaking in the water. Flying the drone from the canoe was a whole new level of tricky ‚Äî first, I had to train my wife to steer us smoothly with the paddle. Only then could I focus on getting the shots, balancing the controls while the boat kept moving under me.\n\nThat night, we sat on the balcony with mugs of hot tea, watching the glacier glow under the fading light.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s2.webp)\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s3.webp)\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s1.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 5 ‚Äì Mission: Touch the Glacier\n\nFrom the viewpoint, B√∏yabreen Glacier looked close ‚Äî like you could stroll over in 15 minutes. Lies.\n\nWe decided to hike to it. The path was barely a path ‚Äî mud, dense forest, then swamps so cold they made our bones ache. Our feet went numb, came back to life, then went numb again. At one point, we had to climb over a fallen tree, water sloshing inside our shoes.\n\nFinally, the forest opened up into a rocky slope. Above us, the glacier loomed ‚Äî blue and white, massive and alive, groaning softly as it shifted. Below, we could see chunks of ice breaking off in the glacier calving, crashing into the cold water. Waterfalls poured down the cliffs nearby, their spray mixing with a gentle rain that cooled our faces. There was no one else around ‚Äî just us, the wind, the falling ice, and the steady drip of melting glacier water.\n\nWe touched it. Hard, smooth, older than anything I‚Äôd ever touched before. My wife stacked some rocks into a little tower ‚Äî our mark that we‚Äôd made it.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Mammoths!](/images/norway2025/g4.webp)\n![B√∏yabreen Glacier](/images/norway2025/g1.webp)\n![B√∏yabreen Glacier Viewpoint](/images/norway2025/g2.webp)\n![B√∏yabreen Glacier Viewpoint](/images/norway2025/g3.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 6 ‚Äì Fj√¶rland ‚Üí Fl√•m\n\nFl√•m was quieter than Geiranger, with the fjord stretching out like a silver ribbon. We drove up to Stegastein viewpoint ‚Äî a platform hanging over the valley. The air was sharp and cool, the kind that wakes you up from the inside out.\n\nWe flew the drone here until the wind picked up, and even the drone seemed to say, ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Fl√•m](/images/norway2025/f1.webp)\n![Aurlandsfjord](/images/norway2025/f2.webp)\n![Stegastein](/images/norway2025/f3.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 7 ‚Äì Fl√•m ‚Üí Oslo ‚Üí Sweden\n\nWe stopped in Oslo again to see friends. Their living room smelled of fresh coffee and warm food. We stayed too long, laughed too much, and ate until I thought I‚Äôd need a nap before driving.\n\nWe left at 4 p.m., the road fading from mountains to the flat Swedish countryside. Pulled into home at 1 a.m., car dusty, drone batteries dead, and memory cards full.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODvbeGMV8Bk\n\nNorway isn‚Äôt just scenery ‚Äî it‚Äôs a mood, a smell, a shock of cold water on your skin, a silence so deep you hear your own heartbeat. It‚Äôs the taste of coffee at a roadside stop with mountains in every direction. And for me, it‚Äôs the feeling of ice under my hand in the middle of summer."},{"slug":"this-cheap-drone-made-my-norway-trip-epic","title":"This Cheap Drone Made My Norway Trip Epic","date":"2025-08-01","tags":["travel","tech","norway","drone"],"coverImage":"/images/drone/dji_fly_20250723_205706_101_1753297038727_photo_optimized-1024x576.webp","content":"\nJust before heading out on our summer road trip in Norway, Amazon started showing me ads for DJI drones ‚Äî and guess what? The DJI Mini 4K was 50 euros cheaper than usual! A drone, on sale, right before our trip? That sounded like the perfect spice to add to our scenic journey ‚Äî especially with our 13th marriage anniversary coming up!\n\nWithout thinking too much, I ordered the DJI Mini 4K drone.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm not a complete newbie when it comes to drones. Back in Bangladesh, one of my close friends is a professional drone operator and a pioneer in drone-related services - [CygnusAerial](https://cygnusaerial.com/). I‚Äôve spent a good amount of time with him, absorbing drone knowledge over tea and tech talk. Once, I even had the chance to fly a professional drone with him over an archaeological site in Bangladesh.\n\nThen I moved to Sweden. After a while, I bought a toy drone ‚Äî nothing fancy, but it kept me entertained for a year. Then came a long break‚Ä¶ until now.\n\nOnce the order was placed, all sorts of questions started popping into my head:\n\n*Can I still fly a drone after all these years? Will I manage to take professional-looking shots? Am I even allowed to fly a drone in Norway? Or in Europe in general? What if it crashes? What if it hits someone or damages a vehicle?!*\n\nPanic mode has been activated!\n\nI even tried to cancel the order. But alas! Amazon informed me that the order was already at the final stage of fulfillment and could no longer be canceled. Ahhh!\n\nSo, instead of returning the drone once it arrived, I decided to face my fears and dig for answers. And guess what? I found a treasure trove of info that I‚Äôm going to share with you here.\n\n## First Things First: Can You Fly a Drone in Europe?\n\nYes! You can. But there are a few conditions. Let‚Äôs break it down.\n\nDrones in Europe are regulated under rules set by **EASA** (European Union Aviation Safety Agency). The good news? There‚Äôs a structured system. The bad news? You probably need a license.\n\nDrones are categorized under the **Open Category** for low-risk operations. This is divided into three subcategories:\n\n1. **class C0**: weight under 250g, allowed to fly over people but not over crowda, usually not required license.\n2. **class C1**: weight under 900g, allowed to fly near people but not over crowds, usually requires A1 license to fly.\n3. **class C2**: weight under 4kg, allowed to fly near people with distance, usually requires A2 license to fly such drones.\n4. **class C3 - C4**: weight under 25kg, should fly far from people, usually requires A3 license to fly such UAS(Unmanned Aircraft System).\n\nYou can usually find the class label on your drone or its packaging. If there‚Äôs no class marking (as with older drones), stricter rules apply.\n\n[üîó More on EASA‚Äôs official site](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/open-category-low-risk-civil-drones)\n\n## Is a License Enough?\n\nShort answer: Nope.\n\nIn most European countries, you‚Äôre strongly advised ‚Äî and often required ‚Äî to have **public liability insurance** for your drone. Even the best drone pilots have unexpected crashes. If your drone hits a person, car, or property, you‚Äôll be responsible for any damages. Public liability insurance covers these risks.\n\nIt‚Äôs not expensive and gives peace of mind. Many insurers offer drone-specific coverage ‚Äî just make sure it fits your usage (recreational vs. commercial).\n\n## Modern Drone Tech: Insanely Smart!\n\nMy other concern was ‚Äî would I be able to capture good drone footage? From my previous experience (as I mentioned earlier), I know that getting truly great shots takes both skill and practice. Drone footage isn‚Äôt just about pressing record ‚Äî it‚Äôs about knowing angles, timing, lighting, and movement.\n\nLuckily, modern drones are packed with features that make capturing stunning footage easier than ever ‚Äî even for someone a bit out of practice like me.Here are just a few features in modern drones like the DJI Mini 4K:\n\n* **Obstacle avoidance**: Sensors help avoid trees, walls, and even power lines. In fact it can detect unevent ground to avoid crash landing!\n\n* **Return to Home**: Automatically returns to launch point if battery is low or signal is lost. I have used this feature most of the times. In fact this feature saved the drone twice.\n\n* **GPS-based stability**: Makes flying smooth, even in windy conditions.\n\n* **Follow-me and auto-tracking**: The drone follows you or a subject automatically!\n\n* **QuickShots and cinematic modes**: Tap a button and it does perfect orbits, spirals, or boomerangs. You just can take movie grade shots just clicking couple of buttons.\n\n* **4K gimbal-stabilized video**: Butter-smooth footage, straight out of the sky.\n\nIn short: even if you‚Äôre not Spielberg, your drone might make it look like you are.\n\n## Local Laws & GDPR: Know Before You Fly\n\nNow here‚Äôs something important people often overlook: **local regulations**.\n\nEven though you‚Äôre allowed to fly drones in Europe under general categories, local rules still apply ‚Äî and they can change *from one town to the next*.\n\n* Don‚Äôt fly near **airports**, **military zones**, **prisons**, **government buildings**, or **restricted airspace**.\n\n* Most of the countries have **national park restrictions**.\n\n* Always check for **temporary flight restrictions (TFRs)** ‚Äî like during public events or emergencies.\n\nAlso, be **GDPR-compliant**. What‚Äôs that?\n\n> **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) is Europe‚Äôs privacy law. It means: don‚Äôt film people without their permission, especially in private areas. If your drone captures identifiable people in sensitive places ‚Äî you could face complaints or even legal action.\n\nUse apps or official websites to check **no-fly zones and airspace restrictions** before every flight. It‚Äôs a small effort that saves big headaches.\n\n## How I Got My Drone License in Norway\n\nSo here‚Äôs what I did:\n\n1. **Registered at flydrone.no**. You can sign up as a private person, an organization, or a drone pilot.\n2. After a few hours, they approved my application and sent a payment link.\n3. I paid around **20 euros** for the year.\n4. Then I selected the **A1/A3 course** ‚Äî which is good for most hobby flights.\n5. After going through the course materials, I took the **online exam**, which was a simple multiple-choice test.\n6. **Boom**! Passed it, got the license, and I was good to go!\n\n![My Drone License](/images/drone/license.webp)\n\nOnce you have a drone license from any EASA member country, it‚Äôs valid across all of Europe (within the EASA zone). That means my Norwegian license lets me fly in countries like France, Spain, Germany, and others ‚Äî as long as I follow their local laws and restrictions. Pretty convenient!\n\nFor the **A2 license**, you need extra skills and have to take an in-person exam at a local traffic station.\n\n## Norway Road Trip with My Drone ‚Äì Watch the Videos\n\nYes ‚Äî I flew the drone! And not just that, I captured some jaw-dropping views of Norway‚Äôs fjords, mountains, waterfalls, and open skies.

Recently I have had a road trip on different parts of Norway and I got curious about these intriguing creatures. I delved into the world of trolls.\n\nTrolls are a fundamental part of Norwegian culture, deeply embedded in art, literature, and media. These mythical beings are often depicted in traditional Norwegian fairy tales and folklore, where they range from menacing antagonists to simple, nature-bound creatures.\n\nIn Norwegian lore, trolls are depicted as real beings living in mountains, forests, or caves. They are often large, connected to nature, and antagonistic towards humans and gods alike. Remarkably, trolls were even mentioned in Norwegian Christian laws, which forbade people from eating with them or waking them up at night.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![William](/images/trolls/trolls_1.webp)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls/trolls_2.webp)\n![Bert](/images/trolls/trolls_3.webp)\n![Branch](/images/trolls/trolls_4.webp)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls/trolls_5.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIn literature and folklore, trolls are usually portrayed as ugly, aggressive creatures with a love for mischief and trickery. They symbolize chaos and disruption and are often associated with the wild, untamed aspects of nature. These stories also spread to Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland, making trolls a common figure in Scandinavian folklore.\n\nInterestingly, the word ‚Äòtroll‚Äô likely originated from the Norwegian words for witches and witchcraft, ‚Äútrollfolk‚Äù and ‚Äútrolldom,‚Äù respectively. This etymology hints at the deep-rooted mysticism and fear surrounding these creatures.\n\nBut trolls aren‚Äôt just confined to old tales. They have found a place in modern culture as well. From the charmingly mischievous troll dolls popularized in the 1960s to the trolls in the ‚ÄúFrozen‚Äù movies, these mythical beings continue to capture our imagination. There‚Äôs even a genre of Scandinavian horror films that bring trolls to life in contemporary settings, blending ancient myths with modern-day storytelling.\n\nSo, the next time you encounter a troll statue in Norway or hear a story about these enigmatic creatures, remember that you‚Äôre tapping into a rich tapestry of folklore that has been woven over centuries. Whether seen as fearsome giants or mischievous tricksters, trolls remain an enduring and fascinating part of Norwegian culture.\n\nIn case want to dive more into trolls here are some movies and books:\n\n***Movies:***\n\n1.
