So we decided to go to **Copenhagen**, the capital of **Denmark**.\n\n### Crossing the √òresund Bridge\n\nOne fine morning, we took the **√òresund train** from Malm√∂ to Copenhagen. The train crosses the famous [**√òresund Bridge**](https://visitskane.com/classic-attractions/oresund-bridge), a long bridge that connects **Sweden** and **Denmark**. It‚Äôs amazing to travel from one country to another in just about 40 minutes!\n\n### First Stop: The Little Mermaid\n\nOur first plan was to meet **The Little Mermaid**, the most famous statue in Copenhagen. We got off the train at **√òsterport Station**, and from there it was only about 15 minutes‚Äô walk.\n\nThe statue is near [**Kastellet Fortress**](https://www.kastellet.com/en/to-do/museum/), a beautiful old fort surrounded by water and walking paths. We walked through the quiet park, and finally ‚Äî there she was!\n\nIt was a cloudy October day, typical weather for Scandinavia. The sky was grey, and the sea was calm. The Little Mermaid looked a bit sad ‚Äî maybe because of the gloomy weather ‚Äî and it showed in all our photos too!\n\n### Who is The Little Mermaid?\n\nThe Little Mermaid is a **bronze sculpture** made by [**Edvard Eriksen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Eriksen) in **1913**. She is based on the famous fairy tale by Danish writer [**Hans Christian Andersen**](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hans-Christian-Andersen-Danish-author).\n\nThe story is about a young mermaid who falls in love with a prince. She dreams of becoming human and gives up her voice to live on land. It‚Äôs a story of love, hope, and sadness ‚Äî and that‚Äôs why the statue also looks thoughtful and lonely.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![](/images/little_mermaid/2.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/3.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/4.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/5.webp)\n![](/images/little_mermaid/6.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n### Behind the scene\n\nHere‚Äôs a lovely part of the story:\nA Danish brewer named [**Carl Jacobsen**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/175-years/a-history-of-brewing/carl-jacobsen/), who also founded the [**Carlsberg**](https://www.carlsberggroup.com/) beer company, went to see a **ballet performance** of *The Little Mermaid* at the [**Royal Danish Theatre**](https://kglteater.dk/en).\n\nHe loved the story so much that he asked the sculptor **Edvard Eriksen** to make a statue of the mermaid. The dancer who played the mermaid in the ballet inspired him, but she didn‚Äôt want to model for the sculpture ‚Äî so Eriksen‚Äôs **wife, [Eline Eriksen](https://dbpedia.org/page/Eline_Eriksen)**, posed instead!\n\nSo, the Little Mermaid you see today is partly inspired by art, love, and family ‚Äî a true Danish creation.\n\n### A Tough Life\n\nEven though she looks peaceful, the Little Mermaid has had a difficult life. Over the years, some people have damaged her many times.\n\n* In **1964**, someone cut off her head!\n* In **1984**, her arm was removed ‚Äî but returned a few days later.\n* In **1998**, her head was stolen again but later found and replaced.\n* In **2003**, she was pushed into the water!\n\nSometimes she is also painted or dressed up during protests. Still, she always comes back ‚Äî strong and smiling again.\n\n### Symbol of Copenhagen\n\nThe Little Mermaid is more than just a statue. She is a **symbol of Copenhagen** ‚Äî just like the **Eiffel Tower** is for Paris or the **Statue of Liberty** is for New York.\n\nShe reminds visitors of Denmark‚Äôs love for art, stories, and the sea. Even though she is small, she has a big place in the hearts of people all around the world.\n\n**Travel Tip:**\nThe best time to visit The Little Mermaid is early in the morning or late in the evening ‚Äî when there are fewer tourists. Bring a jacket (it‚Äôs windy near the water!) and take a quiet moment to enjoy the view of the harbour.\n\n### What‚Äôs Next?\n\nAfter spending some quiet time with the Little Mermaid, we started walking again ‚Äî this time towards Amalienborg Palace, the royal home of the Danish Queen. The beautiful palace square and the changing of the guards were waiting for us!\n\nüëâ Read the next part of our ‚ÄúTrip in Denmark‚Äù series: A Royal Morning at Amalienborg Palace.\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
