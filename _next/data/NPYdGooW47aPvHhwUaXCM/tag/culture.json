Just a few metres from the Øresund strait in Copenhagen sits a place that does exactly that: Den Blå Planet, the National Aquarium of Denmark. This is Northern Europe’s largest, most state-of-the-art aquarium, and it offers not only an impressive collection of marine life, but also a full sensory journey into the mysteries of the ocean.\n\n## First Impressions – A Building Like a Whirlpool\n\nFrom the outside, Den Blå Planet immediately captures your attention. Its architecture is inspired by the swirling motion of a whirlpool — sleek curves of steel and glass that almost appear to be in motion themselves. Walking toward the entrance, you already feel like you’re being pulled into another world.\n\nOnce inside, guests step straight into the “vortex” — a curved lobby that branches into the aquarium’s three main sections. From here, you’re drawn into a labyrinth of 53 aquariums and installations holding more than seven million liters of water, home to thousands of animals from around the globe.\n\n## Getting In – Skipping the Line but Not the Wait\n\nWe had purchased our tickets online, which meant we could skip the ticket counter. However, Den Blå Planet controls visitor numbers carefully to ensure that each guest has the best possible experience. This meant we waited about half an hour at the entrance before being allowed inside. It was a small inconvenience, but once we stepped in, the wait was well worth it.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Alligator gar](/images/blue_planet/6.jpg)\n![The big Aquarium](/images/blue_planet/9.jpg)\n![Shark](/images/blue_planet/2.jpg)\n![Bioluminescent corais macios](/images/blue_planet/11.jpg)\n![Stingray](/images/blue_planet/7.jpg)\n![Xingu River ray](/images/blue_planet/10.jpg)\n![Nemo is looking at us!](/images/blue_planet/1.jpg)\n![Seahorse](/images/blue_planet/3.jpg)\n![The Golden Poison Frog](/images/blue_planet/5.jpg)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/8.jpg)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/12.jpg)\n![Sharks](/images/blue_planet/18.jpg)\n![Red-bellied piranha](/images/blue_planet/13.jpg)\n![Dory!

Digital screens provide detailed information about the animals, and with the press of a button, you can switch between Danish and English.\n\nThroughout the day, there are scheduled activities and live feedings. One of the highlights for me was watching the piranha feeding — equal parts thrilling and educational.\nTo make sure everyone, especially children, has a chance to enjoy the exhibits, Den Blå Planet has marked viewing spots in front of the larger tanks. Families can stand there without blocking others, and kids can enjoy an unobstructed view of the marine life. It’s a thoughtful detail that makes the visit more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n## Tropical Rainforest – A Living Jungle\n\nOne of the most surprising and delightful areas was the tropical rainforest section. It felt like stepping into a miniature jungle: warm air, lush greenery, and the sounds of exotic creatures. Tiny frogs hopped across the pathways, so you had to watch your step carefully. My daughter loved this part, giggling every time she spotted a frog hiding among the leaves. The rainforest also includes other fascinating species, offering a glimpse into ecosystems beyond the ocean.\n\n## The Shark Tunnel – Walking Beneath the Waves\n\nThe true showstopper, however, was the shark tunnel. Imagine walking through a long glass corridor while sharks, giant stingrays, and sea turtles glide gracefully above and around you. The sheer size of the tank makes you feel as if you’ve shrunk and stepped right into the ocean. For children — and adults too — it’s a mesmerizing experience, one that inspires both awe and respect for marine life.\n\n## Interactive Fun for Kids\n\nDen Blå Planet isn’t just about looking — it’s about experiencing. There are touch pools where children (under staff supervision) can gently interact with marine animals. For a 7-year-old birthday girl, this was a dream come true — she got to feel the texture of sea stars and other fascinating creatures, making the day even more special.\nPractical Information – Planning Your Visit\nDen Blå Planet is open 365 days a year, including holidays:\n\n- Monday: 10 am – 9 pm\n- Tuesday – Sunday: 10 am – 5 pm\n- Saturdays (annual pass holders): 9 am – 10 am early entry\n- Peak seasons: daily 10 am – 9 pm\n\nThe building itself covers 10,000 m² indoors with an additional 2,000 m² outdoor area plus parking facilities, so there’s plenty of space to explore.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJY5hgfYkcg\n\n## A Day to Remember\n\nThere are impressive aquariums all over the world, but Den Blå Planet truly stands out for its combination of architecture, atmosphere, and attention to detail. Whether spotting Nemo and Dory or walking through the mesmerizing shark tunnel, the aquarium offers an unforgettable glimpse into the mysteries of the sea.\n\nIf you find yourself in Copenhagen, this is an attraction you shouldn’t miss. For us, it wasn’t just a day at the aquarium — it was an adventure, a birthday gift of wonder and discovery that my daughter (and all of us) will never forget.\n"},{"slug":"swedish-museum-that-makes-kids-smarter-and-adults-amazed","title":"The Swedish Museum That Makes Kids Smarter and Adults Amazed","date":"2025-08-16","tags":["sweden","stockholm","travel","culture"],"coverImage":"/images/nhms/IMG_3971.JPG","author":"","content":"\nWhen I first walked into the **Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet** in Stockholm, I felt like I had just opened a giant storybook about our planet. The building itself looks like it is holding secrets from millions of years ago. And once you step inside, the journey begins.\n\n## Entering a World of Wonders\n\nThe very first thing I noticed was how big the museum is. It’s not one of those places you finish in an hour. No – here you can spend *days* if you really want to explore every single corner.\n\nThe museum is full of different worlds:\n\n* Dinosaurs towering above me, their bones showing the power of life long gone.\n* Shiny gems and colorful stones that looked like treasures from a fairy tale.\n* Animals from every part of Earth – from deep oceans to frozen Arctic lands.\n* A whole section about humans and how we evolved, explained in such a clear way that even kids could tell the story back to you.\n\nAt one point, my daughter started *teaching me* about fossils and animals. That is the magic of this place – children don’t just watch, they explore and learn, and they do it with joy.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Dinosaurs Eggs](/images/nhms/IMG_3976.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3947.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3949.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs](/images/nhms/IMG_3974.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3975.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3981.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3985.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3986.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3987.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3989.JPG)\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3999.JPG)\n![Pre-Historic Rhinoceroses fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4005.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Don’t Miss These Highlights\n\nEvery part of the museum is special, but there are a few experiences that you should not miss:\n\n* **Cosmonova Dome Cinema** – Imagine sitting inside a giant half-globe where the movie surrounds you. One moment you are flying through space, the next you are diving under the sea. It feels so real that you almost forget you are in a chair.\n* **The Dinosaur Hall** – These ancient giants are always a favorite. Standing next to a dinosaur skeleton makes you feel very small.\n* **The Human Journey** – Walk step by step through how humans came to be. It’s like traveling back in time.\n* **Swedish Nature** – A beautiful exhibit that shows forests, lakes, animals, and birds from Sweden. It feels like being outside in nature, but indoors.\n* **Fossils and Gems** – Some sparkle, some look strange, but every stone tells a story millions of years old.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![The Giant Puffball](/images/nhms/IMG_3923.JPG)\n![5kg Lobster](/images/nhms/IMG_3926.JPG)\n![The Giant Crab](/images/nhms/IMG_3929.JPG)\n![The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3934.JPG)\n![My Daughter in front of The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3933.JPG)\n![Iron meteorite](/images/nhms/IMG_3936.JPG)\n![Cross section of a Gigantic tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3952.JPG)\n![Human Evolution Tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3995.JPG)\n![Neanderthals](/images/nhms/IMG_4006.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## A Living Classroom\n\nWhat makes this museum stand out is how interactive it is. It is not just about looking – you can touch, listen, and explore. There are screens where you can read more, buttons to press, and activities for kids.\n\nIt honestly felt like a mix of school, play, and magic. My wife who studied biological science said it was like revisiting our university lessons, but in a fun way. That shows how much detail the museum gives – simple enough for kids, deep enough for adults.\n\n## Tips for Your Visit\n\nHere are some things I learned that will make your visit even better:\n\n* **Take your time.** The museum is huge. Plan at least 3–4 hours, or even more if you include Cosmonova.\n* **Book Cosmonova early.** Shows are popular, and each one takes time.\n* **Bring your own food.** The restaurant *Fossilen* is there, but I liked the calm seating area near the lockers. You can warm food in the microwave and enjoy your meal in peace.\n* **Dress light.** Inside it gets quite warm, even on cold days outside.\n* **Buy tickets online.** This saves you from standing in queues.\n* **Parking is easy.** The cheaper option is by the apartment buildings – only 50kr for the whole day.\n* **Perfect for rainy days.** The museum is all indoors, so it’s a cozy adventure.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3937.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3939.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3943.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3979.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3982.JPG)\n![Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet](/images/nhms/IMG_3909.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## As we finish\n\nWhen I left the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, I felt like I had traveled through time, from the age of dinosaurs to the mysteries of space. This is not just a museum – it’s a living adventure.\n\nIf you are in Stockholm, **don’t miss it**. Whether you are with kids, friends, or even alone, you will come out with new knowledge, fun memories, and maybe even more questions about our amazing world.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4002.JPG)\n![Underwater Life](/images/nhms/IMG_4013.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3983.JPG)\n\n<!--gallery-->\n"},{"slug":"scandinavian-trolls-from-myth-to-modern-magic","title":"Scandinavian Trolls: From Myth to Modern Magic","date":"2023-05-15","tags":["culture","scandinavia","mythology","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/trolls/trolls.webp","content":"\nTrolls are everywhere in Norway, from miniatures and sculptures in shops to street names and countless place names. Recently I have had a road trip on different parts of Norway and I got curious about these intriguing creatures. I delved into the world of trolls.\n\nTrolls are a fundamental part of Norwegian culture, deeply embedded in art, literature, and media. These mythical beings are often depicted in traditional Norwegian fairy tales and folklore, where they range from menacing antagonists to simple, nature-bound creatures.\n\nIn Norwegian lore, trolls are depicted as real beings living in mountains, forests, or caves. They are often large, connected to nature, and antagonistic towards humans and gods alike. Remarkably, trolls were even mentioned in Norwegian Christian laws, which forbade people from eating with them or waking them up at night.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![William](/images/trolls/trolls_1.webp)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls/trolls_2.webp)\n![Bert](/images/trolls/trolls_3.webp)\n![Branch](/images/trolls/trolls_4.webp)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls/trolls_5.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIn literature and folklore, trolls are usually portrayed as ugly, aggressive creatures with a love for mischief and trickery. They symbolize chaos and disruption and are often associated with the wild, untamed aspects of nature. These stories also spread to Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland, making trolls a common figure in Scandinavian folklore.\n\nInterestingly, the word ‘troll’ likely originated from the Norwegian words for witches and witchcraft, “trollfolk” and “trolldom,” respectively. This etymology hints at the deep-rooted mysticism and fear surrounding these creatures.\n\nBut trolls aren’t just confined to old tales. They have found a place in modern culture as well. From the charmingly mischievous troll dolls popularized in the 1960s to the trolls in the “Frozen” movies, these mythical beings continue to capture our imagination. There’s even a genre of Scandinavian horror films that bring trolls to life in contemporary settings, blending ancient myths with modern-day storytelling.\n\nSo, the next time you encounter a troll statue in Norway or hear a story about these enigmatic creatures, remember that you’re tapping into a rich tapestry of folklore that has been woven over centuries. Whether seen as fearsome giants or mischievous tricksters, trolls remain an enduring and fascinating part of Norwegian culture.\n\nIn case want to dive more into trolls here are some movies and books:\n\n***Movies:***\n\n1.
