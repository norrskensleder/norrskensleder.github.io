Just a few metres from the Øresund strait in Copenhagen sits a place that does exactly that: Den Blå Planet, the National Aquarium of Denmark. This is Northern Europe’s largest, most state-of-the-art aquarium, and it offers not only an impressive collection of marine life, but also a full sensory journey into the mysteries of the ocean.\n\n## First Impressions – A Building Like a Whirlpool\n\nFrom the outside, Den Blå Planet immediately captures your attention. Its architecture is inspired by the swirling motion of a whirlpool — sleek curves of steel and glass that almost appear to be in motion themselves. Walking toward the entrance, you already feel like you’re being pulled into another world.\n\nOnce inside, guests step straight into the “vortex” — a curved lobby that branches into the aquarium’s three main sections. From here, you’re drawn into a labyrinth of 53 aquariums and installations holding more than seven million liters of water, home to thousands of animals from around the globe.\n\n## Getting In – Skipping the Line but Not the Wait\n\nWe had purchased our tickets online, which meant we could skip the ticket counter. However, Den Blå Planet controls visitor numbers carefully to ensure that each guest has the best possible experience. This meant we waited about half an hour at the entrance before being allowed inside. It was a small inconvenience, but once we stepped in, the wait was well worth it.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Alligator gar](/images/blue_planet/6.jpg)\n![The big Aquarium](/images/blue_planet/9.jpg)\n![Shark](/images/blue_planet/2.jpg)\n![Bioluminescent corais macios](/images/blue_planet/11.jpg)\n![Stingray](/images/blue_planet/7.jpg)\n![Xingu River ray](/images/blue_planet/10.jpg)\n![Nemo is looking at us!](/images/blue_planet/1.jpg)\n![Seahorse](/images/blue_planet/3.jpg)\n![The Golden Poison Frog](/images/blue_planet/5.jpg)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/8.jpg)\n![Tri-colored poison dart frog](/images/blue_planet/12.jpg)\n![Sharks](/images/blue_planet/18.jpg)\n![Red-bellied piranha](/images/blue_planet/13.jpg)\n![Dory!

Digital screens provide detailed information about the animals, and with the press of a button, you can switch between Danish and English.\n\nThroughout the day, there are scheduled activities and live feedings. One of the highlights for me was watching the piranha feeding — equal parts thrilling and educational.\nTo make sure everyone, especially children, has a chance to enjoy the exhibits, Den Blå Planet has marked viewing spots in front of the larger tanks. Families can stand there without blocking others, and kids can enjoy an unobstructed view of the marine life. It’s a thoughtful detail that makes the visit more enjoyable for everyone.\n\n## Tropical Rainforest – A Living Jungle\n\nOne of the most surprising and delightful areas was the tropical rainforest section. It felt like stepping into a miniature jungle: warm air, lush greenery, and the sounds of exotic creatures. Tiny frogs hopped across the pathways, so you had to watch your step carefully. My daughter loved this part, giggling every time she spotted a frog hiding among the leaves. The rainforest also includes other fascinating species, offering a glimpse into ecosystems beyond the ocean.\n\n## The Shark Tunnel – Walking Beneath the Waves\n\nThe true showstopper, however, was the shark tunnel. Imagine walking through a long glass corridor while sharks, giant stingrays, and sea turtles glide gracefully above and around you. The sheer size of the tank makes you feel as if you’ve shrunk and stepped right into the ocean. For children — and adults too — it’s a mesmerizing experience, one that inspires both awe and respect for marine life.\n\n## Interactive Fun for Kids\n\nDen Blå Planet isn’t just about looking — it’s about experiencing. There are touch pools where children (under staff supervision) can gently interact with marine animals. For a 7-year-old birthday girl, this was a dream come true — she got to feel the texture of sea stars and other fascinating creatures, making the day even more special.\nPractical Information – Planning Your Visit\nDen Blå Planet is open 365 days a year, including holidays:\n\n- Monday: 10 am – 9 pm\n- Tuesday – Sunday: 10 am – 5 pm\n- Saturdays (annual pass holders): 9 am – 10 am early entry\n- Peak seasons: daily 10 am – 9 pm\n\nThe building itself covers 10,000 m² indoors with an additional 2,000 m² outdoor area plus parking facilities, so there’s plenty of space to explore.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJY5hgfYkcg\n\n## A Day to Remember\n\nThere are impressive aquariums all over the world, but Den Blå Planet truly stands out for its combination of architecture, atmosphere, and attention to detail. Whether spotting Nemo and Dory or walking through the mesmerizing shark tunnel, the aquarium offers an unforgettable glimpse into the mysteries of the sea.\n\nIf you find yourself in Copenhagen, this is an attraction you shouldn’t miss. For us, it wasn’t just a day at the aquarium — it was an adventure, a birthday gift of wonder and discovery that my daughter (and all of us) will never forget.\n"},{"slug":"journey-to-catch-the-northern-lights-beyond-the-arctic-circle","title":"Under the Blue Hole: Our Journey to Catch the Northern Lights Beyond the Arctic Circle","date":"2025-08-15","tags":["scandinavia","sweden","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/winterabisko/IMG_4251.jpeg","content":"At the end of 2022, we had to renew our passports.\nFrom the quiet south of Sweden, we set our eyes on Stockholm, where the embassy waited. It would be a long, slow journey by train — six hours of rails stretching through frost and distance.\n\nBut winter has its own way of whispering temptations, and we listened.\nIf we were already traveling north, why not keep going? Why not continue past cities and forests, past the comfort of the familiar, to a place where the earth tilts toward the sky — Abisko, far beyond the Arctic Circle, seventeen hours by train from Stockholm.\n\nAfter the embassy appointment, we boarded the night train on the 29th of November, just after six in the evening. We had booked a sleeper cabin: warm, tidy, with a shower, thick blankets, and the comforting sense that the night would belong entirely to us. Our luggage was heavy with winter clothing; the forecasts spoke of -15°C.\n\nWe slept early, and so we woke early.\n\nIn the darkness, I pulled up the blind from the window. The world outside was not the one we had left. The train slid silently through a kingdom of white — frozen lakes, glassy rivers, mountains dressed in snow, and forests stripped bare except for the stubborn pines. Coming from a warm South Asian country, we had never seen such a thing: a landscape so still and pale it could have been another planet. We remained by the window, unwilling to close our eyes again, watching the ghostly scenery until the train whispered into Abisko around noon.\n\nIt was the 30th of November.\n\nAbisko is a small village in the shadow of Sweden’s mining town, Kiruna, and the mountains that cradle it. Only one grocery store stands here, its windows glowing faintly in the Polar Night — for in winter, the sun never rises above the horizon.\n\nAbisko is more than a village. It is a place of study, where scientists from around the world gather to measure the breath of the Arctic. Since 1913, the Abisko Scientific Research Station has recorded the winds, the snow, the slow thawing of permafrost. It is also a place where the sky holds a secret: a microclimate, the *blue hole*, which grants clearer skies than most of the Arctic. And in those skies, when the clouds part, the Northern Lights appear.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Abisko Central Station](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4027.JPG)\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2141.jpeg)\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4031.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nOur hotel was a fifteen-minute walk from the station, along an icy road that shimmered under the dim light. We settled in, cooked simple meals from our grocery bags, played with our daughter in the snow, and wandered to the frozen lake to feel the silence.\n\nOn December 1st, we set out on the Nissunjåkka Suspension Bridge trail — 8.4 kilometers through birch forests and along the Abiskojokk River, the air so sharp it seemed to cut sound itself. There were moments when we were the only living souls in sight. Three and a half hours later, we returned to the hotel under a sky that refused to turn day. That night, we walked again toward the lake, hoping the heavens might open — but the clouds remained, and the sky kept its secret.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4167.jpeg)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4180.JPG)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_1881.jpeg)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4206.jpeg)\n![slipped in icy river](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4155.jpeg)\n![mountains and lake](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4354.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next day, we traced another path: the Östra Loop Trail, 11.3 kilometers of snow, river, and canyon. Words cannot hold the beauty of Abisko in winter; it is not something seen but something breathed. Still, the sky stayed veiled, and we began to think ourselves unlucky.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4301.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4292.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4290.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4280.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4300.JPG)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2095.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIt was my wife who suggested the chase.\nThe hotel organized nightly journeys for those unwilling to leave without seeing the aurora. That night, December 2nd, at nine o’clock, we boarded one of three small buses with travelers from across the world. Our guide was from Argentina, now a man of the north, and we spoke of Maradona and the mad devotion of Bangladesh to football.\n\nThe chase was a patient game. We drove from valley to ridge, from frozen road to silent clearing, looking for a patch of sky with fewer clouds. Finally, the guide stopped and stepped out into the freezing night. Coffee and warm lingonberry juice were passed around. We waited. The cold sank into our bones.\n\nThen — a shout.\n\nWe looked up. At first, we saw nothing but the night. The guide told us to keep looking, to let our eyes learn. Slowly, faint grains of light gathered overhead, as if someone were sifting silver dust across the heavens. The shapes thickened, spread, twisted. The sky began to move. Green ribbons unfurled, curling and folding like smoke in a wind only the stars could feel. Light danced from one edge of the horizon to the other, fading in one place as it flared in another.\n\nIt lasted perhaps twenty minutes, perhaps forever.\n\nWe stood there, strangers bound together by awe, each of us quietly aware that we were inside a memory we would never lose. I had seen the aurora later, from the backyard of our home in southern Sweden, but never like this — in the deep of the Arctic night, with the whole sky breathing above us.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4029.jpeg)\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2120.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next morning, we began the long journey south. The light we had chased stayed with us, a flicker behind the eyes, as if some part of the north had followed us home.\n"},{"slug":"from-forest-trails-to-glaciers-our-most-unforgettable-week-in-norway","title":"From Forest Trails to Glaciers: Our Most Unforgettable Week in Norway","date":"2025-08-06","tags":["scandinavia","itinerary","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/norway2025/1.jpg","content":"\nYou know that smart idea you have when you’re already tired? That’s how this trip started.\n\nWe had just finished moving apartments — in the middle of summer, sweating like we were in a gym we didn’t sign up for. Our backs ached, our muscles felt like jelly, and the idea of packing again for a vacation sounded like punishment.\n\nBut then… the little voice in my head went, “You know what you need? A road trip.”\n\nAnd not just any road trip — a 7-day drive through central and western Norway. Because obviously, the cure for exhaustion is… more exhaustion.\n\n## The Drone Plan\n\nTo spice things up, we bought a drone. Not the toy kind — the one that makes you feel like a movie director.\n\nOf course, in Europe, you can’t just fly a drone wherever you want unless you like paying fines the size of a small car. So the week before the trip, I was cramming drone pilot courses like a college student before finals.\n\nBy the time we left, I had my EU license, the drone was charged, and I was ready to terrorize seagulls across Norway.\n\n## Setting the Route\n\nWe had 7 days. 2 would disappear in just getting from Sweden to Norway and back. That left 5 days to:\n\n- Drive scenic roads\n- See waterfalls, fjords, and glaciers\n- Take more drone shots than a human should\n\nOne driver, one rest day in the middle, and one big rule: the trip’s mission was to touch a glacier.\n\nTrollstigen — the legendary mountain road — had just opened for the season, so it became our farthest point before turning back. But the real prize was Bøyabreen Glacier in Fjærland.\n\nThe route looked like this:\nOslo → Trollstigen → Geiranger → Bøyabreen Glacier, Fjærland → Flåm → Oslo\n\n## Packing Like a Doomsday Prepper\n\nNorway is beautiful, but if you shop there too much, your wallet starts crying. So we packed like we were going on an Arctic survival mission:\n\n- Portable stove & gas cans\n- Canned food, protein bars, fruit, nuts\n- Coffee & tea (because you don’t mess with caffeine supply)\n\nThe plan was simple — cook in scenic spots, avoid overpriced restaurants, and stay away from big cities as much as possible.\n\n## Day 1 – Sweden → Oslo\n\nThe morning of 19th July was golden and warm, with that gentle breeze that makes you think the world’s in a good mood. We left at 9 a.m., windows down, music up, and the back of the car rattling with camping gear.\n\nAbout two hours in, we pulled over at a rest stop — one of those quiet roadside spots where the only sound is the wind in the trees and the occasional truck rumbling past. We unpacked the stove, chopped up some vegetables, and fried them in the open air. The smell of sizzling onions mixed with pine trees and hot asphalt — oddly comforting.\n\nWhile lunch was cooking, I unpacked the drone. The first flight was shaky, my fingers a little clumsy, but within minutes I was zipping it over the tree line, watching the tiny live feed of endless forest.\n\nBy late afternoon, Oslo’s skyline appeared. My wife’s friend met us at the door with that big smile only old friends give you. Inside, the smell of Bangladeshi spices hit me first — warm, homey, like a hug for your stomach. We ate until we couldn’t move.\n\n## Day 2 – Oslo → Lesjaskogsvatnet Camping\n\nWe rolled out of Oslo around 10 a.m., our trusty volvo v60 humming along narrow roads lined with red-painted houses..\n\nFirst stop was Ringebu Stave Church. The wooden walls were the color of dark honey, weathered by centuries of wind and snow. Inside, the air smelled of dry wood and history. You could almost hear the shuffle of boots from hundreds of years ago.\n\nNext was Myfallet Waterfall. The road there narrowed into something that looked like a driveway, ending in a barrier. We hiked through a forest so green it looked fake, the air heavy with the smell of wet leaves. The waterfall roared in the distance before we even saw it.\n\nWe couldn’t resist — we waded into the river. The water was cool and sharp, the kind that makes you gasp at first but then feels perfect on a warm summer day.\n\nBy then, we were too tired for our third planned stop. We headed straight to Lesjaskogsvatnet Camping, a lake so still it reflected the mountains like a mirror. The only sound was the soft slap of water against the shore. That evening, we flew the drone as the sky turned orange, the lake glowing like molten gold.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Ringebu Stave Church](/images/norway2025/DJI_0019.jpeg)\n![Myfallet](/images/norway2025/DJI_0029.jpeg)\n![Lesjaskogsvatnet Lake](/images/norway2025/DJI_0030.jpeg)\n![Mya River](/images/norway2025/myfallet.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 3 – Trollstigen & Geiranger\n\nWe started early.\n\nTrollstigen is not just a road — it’s a dare. Eleven hairpin bends, a 10% incline, and cliffs so steep you wonder if the guardrails are just decorative. Waterfalls burst out of the rock on both sides.\n\nFrom the top, Trollstigen looked unreal — a silver ribbon curling down the mountainside in eleven tight bends. We sent the drone gliding over the valley, capturing the tiny cars far below, the waterfalls crashing down beside them, and the still blue lake above, quietly feeding all that power.\n\nBy midday, we reached Geiranger. The fjord was glassy blue, framed by cliffs and waterfalls with names like “Seven Sisters” and “The Bridal Veil.” Unfortunately, it was also packed with tourists — cruise ships, buses, and people everywhere. The smell of sunscreen and fried food floated in the warm air. We didn’t linger.\n\nWe ended the day at Djupvatnet Lake, high in the mountains. The air was thin and cool, the water so clear it was like looking into another world. The drone footage here is a Chef’s kiss.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Geirangerfjord](/images/norway2025/gei_01.jpeg)\n![Seven Sisters Waterfall](/images/norway2025/gei_02.jpeg)\n![Geirangerfjord](/images/norway2025/gei_03.jpeg)\n![Trollstigen road](/images/norway2025/trolls_1.jpeg)\n![Trollstigen](/images/norway2025/trolls_2.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 4 – Sunnfjord: The Lake, The Fish, The Waterfall\n\nThis was supposed to be a lazy day. Just 122 km.\n\nWe reached our cottage by early afternoon — and our jaws dropped. On two sides: mountains. On another: a crystal-clear lake, greenish-blue, so calm it felt wrong to disturb it, and in front of us: a roaring waterfall straight from the glacier.\n\nWe dumped our bags and ran straight into the lake water. It was cold enough to make my chest tighten — but then came the tickling. Fish, tiny and curious, nibbling at our toes. Nature’s spa treatment.\n\nLater, we took the canoe out. Every stroke of the paddle sent ripples across the mirrored surface, mountains and sky bending and breaking in the water. Flying the drone from the canoe was a whole new level of tricky — first, I had to train my wife to steer us smoothly with the paddle. Only then could I focus on getting the shots, balancing the controls while the boat kept moving under me.\n\nThat night, we sat on the balcony with mugs of hot tea, watching the glacier glow under the fading light.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s2.jpeg)\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s3.jpeg)\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s1.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 5 – Mission: Touch the Glacier\n\nFrom the viewpoint, Bøyabreen Glacier looked close — like you could stroll over in 15 minutes. Lies.\n\nWe decided to hike to it. The path was barely a path — mud, dense forest, then swamps so cold they made our bones ache. Our feet went numb, came back to life, then went numb again. At one point, we had to climb over a fallen tree, water sloshing inside our shoes.\n\nFinally, the forest opened up into a rocky slope. Above us, the glacier loomed — blue and white, massive and alive, groaning softly as it shifted. Below, we could see chunks of ice breaking off in the glacier calving, crashing into the cold water. Waterfalls poured down the cliffs nearby, their spray mixing with a gentle rain that cooled our faces. There was no one else around — just us, the wind, the falling ice, and the steady drip of melting glacier water.\n\nWe touched it. Hard, smooth, older than anything I’d ever touched before. My wife stacked some rocks into a little tower — our mark that we’d made it.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Mammoths!](/images/norway2025/g4.jpg)\n![Bøyabreen Glacier](/images/norway2025/g1.jpeg)\n![Bøyabreen Glacier Viewpoint](/images/norway2025/g2.jpeg)\n![Bøyabreen Glacier Viewpoint](/images/norway2025/g3.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 6 – Fjærland → Flåm\n\nFlåm was quieter than Geiranger, with the fjord stretching out like a silver ribbon. We drove up to Stegastein viewpoint — a platform hanging over the valley. The air was sharp and cool, the kind that wakes you up from the inside out.\n\nWe flew the drone here until the wind picked up, and even the drone seemed to say, “Nope.”\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Flåm](/images/norway2025/f1.jpeg)\n![Aurlandsfjord](/images/norway2025/f2.jpeg)\n![Stegastein](/images/norway2025/f3.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 7 – Flåm → Oslo → Sweden\n\nWe stopped in Oslo again to see friends. Their living room smelled of fresh coffee and warm food. We stayed too long, laughed too much, and ate until I thought I’d need a nap before driving.\n\nWe left at 4 p.m., the road fading from mountains to the flat Swedish countryside. Pulled into home at 1 a.m., car dusty, drone batteries dead, and memory cards full.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODvbeGMV8Bk\n\nNorway isn’t just scenery — it’s a mood, a smell, a shock of cold water on your skin, a silence so deep you hear your own heartbeat. It’s the taste of coffee at a roadside stop with mountains in every direction. And for me, it’s the feeling of ice under my hand in the middle of summer."},{"slug":"scandinavian-trolls-from-myth-to-modern-magic","title":"Scandinavian Trolls: From Myth to Modern Magic","date":"2023-05-15","tags":["culture","scandinavia","mythology","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/trolls.jpg","content":"\nTrolls are everywhere in Norway, from miniatures and sculptures in shops to street names and countless place names. Recently I have had a road trip on different parts of Norway and I got curious about these intriguing creatures. I delved into the world of trolls.\n\nTrolls are a fundamental part of Norwegian culture, deeply embedded in art, literature, and media. These mythical beings are often depicted in traditional Norwegian fairy tales and folklore, where they range from menacing antagonists to simple, nature-bound creatures.\n\nIn Norwegian lore, trolls are depicted as real beings living in mountains, forests, or caves. They are often large, connected to nature, and antagonistic towards humans and gods alike. Remarkably, trolls were even mentioned in Norwegian Christian laws, which forbade people from eating with them or waking them up at night.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![William](/images/trolls_1.JPG)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls_2.JPG)\n![Bert](/images/trolls_3.JPG)\n![Branch](/images/trolls_4.JPG)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls_5.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIn literature and folklore, trolls are usually portrayed as ugly, aggressive creatures with a love for mischief and trickery. They symbolize chaos and disruption and are often associated with the wild, untamed aspects of nature. These stories also spread to Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland, making trolls a common figure in Scandinavian folklore.\n\nInterestingly, the word ‘troll’ likely originated from the Norwegian words for witches and witchcraft, “trollfolk” and “trolldom,” respectively. This etymology hints at the deep-rooted mysticism and fear surrounding these creatures.\n\nBut trolls aren’t just confined to old tales. They have found a place in modern culture as well. From the charmingly mischievous troll dolls popularized in the 1960s to the trolls in the “Frozen” movies, these mythical beings continue to capture our imagination. There’s even a genre of Scandinavian horror films that bring trolls to life in contemporary settings, blending ancient myths with modern-day storytelling.\n\nSo, the next time you encounter a troll statue in Norway or hear a story about these enigmatic creatures, remember that you’re tapping into a rich tapestry of folklore that has been woven over centuries. Whether seen as fearsome giants or mischievous tricksters, trolls remain an enduring and fascinating part of Norwegian culture.\n\nIn case want to dive more into trolls here are some movies and books:\n\n***Movies:***\n\n1.
