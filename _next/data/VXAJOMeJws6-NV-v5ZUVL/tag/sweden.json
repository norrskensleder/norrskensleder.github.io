The building itself looks like it is holding secrets from millions of years ago. And once you step inside, the journey begins.\n\n## Entering a World of Wonders\n\nThe very first thing I noticed was how big the museum is. It’s not one of those places you finish in an hour. No – here you can spend *days* if you really want to explore every single corner.\n\nThe museum is full of different worlds:\n\n* Dinosaurs towering above me, their bones showing the power of life long gone.\n* Shiny gems and colorful stones that looked like treasures from a fairy tale.\n* Animals from every part of Earth – from deep oceans to frozen Arctic lands.\n* A whole section about humans and how we evolved, explained in such a clear way that even kids could tell the story back to you.\n\nAt one point, my daughter started *teaching me* about fossils and animals. That is the magic of this place – children don’t just watch, they explore and learn, and they do it with joy.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Dinosaurs Eggs](/images/nhms/IMG_3976.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3947.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3949.webp)\n![Dinosaurs](/images/nhms/IMG_3974.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3975.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3981.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3985.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3986.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3987.webp)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3989.webp)\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3999.webp)\n![Pre-Historic Rhinoceroses fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4005.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Don’t Miss These Highlights\n\nEvery part of the museum is special, but there are a few experiences that you should not miss:\n\n* **Cosmonova Dome Cinema** – Imagine sitting inside a giant half-globe where the movie surrounds you. One moment you are flying through space, the next you are diving under the sea. It feels so real that you almost forget you are in a chair.\n* **The Dinosaur Hall** – These ancient giants are always a favorite. Standing next to a dinosaur skeleton makes you feel very small.\n* **The Human Journey** – Walk step by step through how humans came to be. It’s like traveling back in time.\n* **Swedish Nature** – A beautiful exhibit that shows forests, lakes, animals, and birds from Sweden. It feels like being outside in nature, but indoors.\n* **Fossils and Gems** – Some sparkle, some look strange, but every stone tells a story millions of years old.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![The Giant Puffball](/images/nhms/IMG_3923.webp)\n![5kg Lobster](/images/nhms/IMG_3926.webp)\n![The Giant Crab](/images/nhms/IMG_3929.webp)\n![The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3934.webp)\n![My Daughter in front of The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3933.webp)\n![Iron meteorite](/images/nhms/IMG_3936.webp)\n![Cross section of a Gigantic tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3952.webp)\n![Human Evolution Tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3995.webp)\n![Neanderthals](/images/nhms/IMG_4006.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## A Living Classroom\n\nWhat makes this museum stand out is how interactive it is. It is not just about looking – you can touch, listen, and explore. There are screens where you can read more, buttons to press, and activities for kids.\n\nIt honestly felt like a mix of school, play, and magic. My wife who studied biological science said it was like revisiting our university lessons, but in a fun way. That shows how much detail the museum gives – simple enough for kids, deep enough for adults.\n\n## Tips for Your Visit\n\nHere are some things I learned that will make your visit even better:\n\n* **Take your time.** The museum is huge. Plan at least 3–4 hours, or even more if you include Cosmonova.\n* **Book Cosmonova early.** Shows are popular, and each one takes time.\n* **Bring your own food.** The restaurant *Fossilen* is there, but I liked the calm seating area near the lockers. You can warm food in the microwave and enjoy your meal in peace.\n* **Dress light.** Inside it gets quite warm, even on cold days outside.\n* **Buy tickets online.** This saves you from standing in queues.\n* **Parking is easy.** The cheaper option is by the apartment buildings – only 50kr for the whole day.\n* **Perfect for rainy days.** The museum is all indoors, so it’s a cozy adventure.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3937.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3939.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3943.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3979.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3982.webp)\n![Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet](/images/nhms/IMG_3909.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## As we finish\n\nWhen I left the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, I felt like I had traveled through time, from the age of dinosaurs to the mysteries of space. This is not just a museum – it’s a living adventure.\n\nIf you are in Stockholm, **don’t miss it**. Whether you are with kids, friends, or even alone, you will come out with new knowledge, fun memories, and maybe even more questions about our amazing world.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4002.webp)\n![Underwater Life](/images/nhms/IMG_4013.webp)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3983.webp)\n\n<!--gallery-->\n"},{"slug":"journey-to-catch-the-northern-lights-beyond-the-arctic-circle","title":"Under the Blue Hole: Our Journey to Catch the Northern Lights Beyond the Arctic Circle","date":"2025-08-15","tags":["scandinavia","sweden","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/winterabisko/IMG_4251.webp","content":"At the end of 2022, we had to renew our passports.\nFrom the quiet south of Sweden, we set our eyes on Stockholm, where the embassy waited. It would be a long, slow journey by train — six hours of rails stretching through frost and distance.\n\nBut winter has its own way of whispering temptations, and we listened.\nIf we were already traveling north, why not keep going? Why not continue past cities and forests, past the comfort of the familiar, to a place where the earth tilts toward the sky — Abisko, far beyond the Arctic Circle, seventeen hours by train from Stockholm.\n\nAfter the embassy appointment, we boarded the night train on the 29th of November, just after six in the evening. We had booked a sleeper cabin: warm, tidy, with a shower, thick blankets, and the comforting sense that the night would belong entirely to us. Our luggage was heavy with winter clothing; the forecasts spoke of -15°C.\n\nWe slept early, and so we woke early.\n\nIn the darkness, I pulled up the blind from the window. The world outside was not the one we had left. The train slid silently through a kingdom of white — frozen lakes, glassy rivers, mountains dressed in snow, and forests stripped bare except for the stubborn pines. Coming from a warm South Asian country, we had never seen such a thing: a landscape so still and pale it could have been another planet. We remained by the window, unwilling to close our eyes again, watching the ghostly scenery until the train whispered into Abisko around noon.\n\nIt was the 30th of November.\n\nAbisko is a small village in the shadow of Sweden’s mining town, Kiruna, and the mountains that cradle it. Only one grocery store stands here, its windows glowing faintly in the Polar Night — for in winter, the sun never rises above the horizon.\n\nAbisko is more than a village. It is a place of study, where scientists from around the world gather to measure the breath of the Arctic. Since 1913, the Abisko Scientific Research Station has recorded the winds, the snow, the slow thawing of permafrost. It is also a place where the sky holds a secret: a microclimate, the *blue hole*, which grants clearer skies than most of the Arctic. And in those skies, when the clouds part, the Northern Lights appear.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Abisko Central Station](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4027.webp)\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2141.webp)\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4031.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nOur hotel was a fifteen-minute walk from the station, along an icy road that shimmered under the dim light. We settled in, cooked simple meals from our grocery bags, played with our daughter in the snow, and wandered to the frozen lake to feel the silence.\n\nOn December 1st, we set out on the Nissunjåkka Suspension Bridge trail — 8.4 kilometers through birch forests and along the Abiskojokk River, the air so sharp it seemed to cut sound itself. There were moments when we were the only living souls in sight. Three and a half hours later, we returned to the hotel under a sky that refused to turn day. That night, we walked again toward the lake, hoping the heavens might open — but the clouds remained, and the sky kept its secret.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4167.webp)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4180.webp)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_1881.webp)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4206.webp)\n![slipped in icy river](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4155.webp)\n![mountains and lake](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4354.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next day, we traced another path: the Östra Loop Trail, 11.3 kilometers of snow, river, and canyon. Words cannot hold the beauty of Abisko in winter; it is not something seen but something breathed. Still, the sky stayed veiled, and we began to think ourselves unlucky.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4301.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4292.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4290.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4280.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4300.webp)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2095.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIt was my wife who suggested the chase.\nThe hotel organized nightly journeys for those unwilling to leave without seeing the aurora. That night, December 2nd, at nine o’clock, we boarded one of three small buses with travelers from across the world. Our guide was from Argentina, now a man of the north, and we spoke of Maradona and the mad devotion of Bangladesh to football.\n\nThe chase was a patient game. We drove from valley to ridge, from frozen road to silent clearing, looking for a patch of sky with fewer clouds. Finally, the guide stopped and stepped out into the freezing night. Coffee and warm lingonberry juice were passed around. We waited. The cold sank into our bones.\n\nThen — a shout.\n\nWe looked up. At first, we saw nothing but the night. The guide told us to keep looking, to let our eyes learn. Slowly, faint grains of light gathered overhead, as if someone were sifting silver dust across the heavens. The shapes thickened, spread, twisted. The sky began to move. Green ribbons unfurled, curling and folding like smoke in a wind only the stars could feel. Light danced from one edge of the horizon to the other, fading in one place as it flared in another.\n\nIt lasted perhaps twenty minutes, perhaps forever.\n\nWe stood there, strangers bound together by awe, each of us quietly aware that we were inside a memory we would never lose. I had seen the aurora later, from the backyard of our home in southern Sweden, but never like this — in the deep of the Arctic night, with the whole sky breathing above us.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4029.webp)\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2120.webp)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next morning, we began the long journey south. The light we had chased stayed with us, a flicker behind the eyes, as if some part of the north had followed us home.\n"},{"slug":"the-brutally-honest-guide-to-getting-a-swedish-driving-license","title":"The Brutally Honest Guide to Getting a Swedish Driving License (Without Going Broke or Losing Your Mind)","date":"2025-08-14","tags":["sweden","driving","life","tips"],"coverImage":"/images/driving_license/4q8l084q8l084q8l.webp","author":"","content":"\nObtaining a driving license in Sweden is quite a challenging process — both mentally and financially.\n\nThe country has clearly defined standards and checkpoints that you must meet to pass. It is mentally demanding because instructors and examiners may fail you for even a small deviation from those standards. For example, when turning right, if you check the rear-view mirror and right mirror but forget to check your right-side blind spot, you will fail.\n\n## Financial Reality\n\nFor many Swedes, the process is easier financially. They often get support from their parents, who can act as instructors and provide a car for practice. Before taking the real exam, they may have 100–500 hours of driving practice. Statistically, it is said that you need at least 200 hours of driving to develop strong muscle memory.\n\nFor newcomers like me, it’s even more frustrating. We may not know the Swedish language or culture, and even if we already have a license from another country, our driving style may be seen as aggressive here. In many cases, we must relearn driving entirely according to Swedish standards.\n\nIf you rely fully on driving schools, money becomes a major factor. One lesson costs around 1,200 SEK for 80 minutes (at the time of this writing). To reach 200 hours through a school, you’d need around 150 lessons — costing about **180,000 SEK**.\n\nIn practice, if you have prior driving experience, you might need a minimum 30–40 lessons (around 48,000 SEK). For complete beginners 40-100 lessons, costs can easily reach 100,000 SEK. If you plan to rely entirely on a driving school, save this money beforehand based on your situation. Pausing midway and resuming later often means retaking many lessons.\n\n## Time Commitment\n\nTime is another key factor. You’ll need to dedicate time for studying, dealing with frustration, and even walking around to learn local roads and traffic conditions. If you’re already stressed, pursuing a license will feel much harder.\n\nIdeally, set aside **2–4 months** to focus on your driving license as a top priority during that period.\n\n**Seasonal tip:** Plan your entire activity so that your practical exam falls around **July or August**. For example:\n\n- March: Begin the process and apply for your learner’s permit.\n- April: Finish reading the theory book.\n- April–May: Focus on theory studies.\n- May–July: Practical driving lessons.\n- July–August: Take your practical exam.\n\nThis plan gives you long daylight hours for practice, which is much easier than learning in winter darkness.\n\n## Sweden’s Road Safety Approach\n\nSweden aims to minimize accidents and fatalities through strict standards and defensive driving principles. Drivers are expected to anticipate potential hazards and act appropriately in any situation. A driving license may offer freedom, but it comes with serious responsibility.\n\nUnderstanding the [**standard checkpoints**](https://trafikverket.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1389795/FULLTEXT04.pdf) before your exam is critical. I highly recommend reading [this free online theory book](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/K%C3%B6rkortonline_se_Theory_Book_Driving_Licence_Book?id=PzWxEAAAQBAJ) to get a solid grasp of what Transportstyrelsen expects from drivers. I even recommend it to city cyclists and predistrans.\n\n## Steps to Get a Driving License in Sweden (B-Type)\n\n> All the following information applies to a **B-type driving license**.\n\n### 1. Eye Test\n\nMake sure your vision meets the requirements. Visit any optician and request an eye exam for a driving license. The optician will send the results directly to Transportstyrelsen. This usually costs 100–150 SEK.\n\n### 2. Learner’s Permit\n\nOnce your eye test is approved, you can apply for a learner’s permit.\n\n### 3. Risk Training\n\n**Risk 1 (Riskettan)**\nA theoretical course covering alcohol, drugs, fatigue, and other risky behaviors that impair driving. Cost: 400–1,100 SEK.\n\n**Risk 2 (Halkbana)**\nA practical course that teaches handling dangerous situations, especially skidding on slippery roads — common in Nordic winters. Cost: 2,000–3,000 SEK.\n\nBoth Risk 1 and Risk 2 are valid for **five years**. You can search for [authorised instructors offering risk courses here](https://lisutb-p.transportstyrelsen.se/extweb/#/).\n\n### 4. Theory Study\n\nCovers traffic rules, signs, safety, vehicle knowledge, and eco-driving.\n\n- Course cost: 400–1,500 SEK (depending on provider).\n- 70 multiple-choice questions (5 are trial questions and don’t count).\n- Passing score: 52 correct answers.\n- Duration: 50 minutes.\n- Theory test cost: 420–520 SEK.\n- Pass is valid for **four months**.\n\nThere are many online theory practice tools — choose one that suits you. You can study through a driving school, but it’s not mandatory.\n\n**Tip:** Alternate theory study with practical lessons to reinforce learning.\n\n### 5. Practical Lessons\n\nYou can train at a driving school, with a private instructor, or both. Private practice requires an [introductory course with your supervising driver at an approved school](https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/en/road/driving-licences/permits-for-driving-training/).\n\nSince lessons are expensive, book them when you are calm and focused. Have at least a one-hour buffer before and after each lesson to avoid stress.\n\nStick to one instructor if possible. Changing schools often disrupts progress and costs more in the long run.\n\n### 6. Practical Exam\n\n- Cost: 1,000–1,400 SEK.\n- Best time slots: ***09:30*** –***11:00*** or ***13:30*** –***15:30*** for lighter traffic.\n- Aim for summer months when roads are quieter and weather is favorable.\n- It matters where you practice and where you book your exam. Target the practical exam center first, then focus your practice in that city. This way, you’ll become familiar with local roads, traffic patterns, and common challenges in that area. Generally, the quieter the city, the higher your chances of passing the exam on the first try.\n\n## Cheaper Alternatives\n\n- If you’ve been a Swedish resident for less than a year and have a valid non-EEA license, you can drive for one year. During this time, buy a cheap car, practice, study theory, take some lessons, and then book your test.\n- Some people swap licenses in another country first (e.g., Denmark) and then exchange them for a Swedish license — if their original license is swappable there.\n\n## Foreign Driving Licenses in Sweden\n\n- **Non-EEA licenses**: Valid for 1 year after becoming a Swedish resident. After that, you must pass the Swedish tests.\n- **EEA licenses**: Valid until expiry. You can also swap them for a Swedish license.\n\n## Summing up\n\n![Swedish Driving License Checklist](/images/driving_license/sweden_driving_license_checklist.webp)\n\nThe two most important factors are **time** and **money**. Set aside the full budget so you don’t have to stop midway, and dedicate 3–5 months of focused effort. The rest is discipline, patience, and persistence.\n\nIf you think I’ve missed something or have experiences of your own to share, feel free to leave a comment below.
