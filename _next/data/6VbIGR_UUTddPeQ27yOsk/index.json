The building itself looks like it is holding secrets from millions of years ago. And once you step inside, the journey begins.\n\n## Entering a World of Wonders\n\nThe very first thing I noticed was how big the museum is. It’s not one of those places you finish in an hour. No – here you can spend *days* if you really want to explore every single corner.\n\nThe museum is full of different worlds:\n\n* Dinosaurs towering above me, their bones showing the power of life long gone.\n* Shiny gems and colorful stones that looked like treasures from a fairy tale.\n* Animals from every part of Earth – from deep oceans to frozen Arctic lands.\n* A whole section about humans and how we evolved, explained in such a clear way that even kids could tell the story back to you.\n\nAt one point, my daughter started *teaching me* about fossils and animals. That is the magic of this place – children don’t just watch, they explore and learn, and they do it with joy.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3947.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3949.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs](/images/nhms/IMG_3974.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3975.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3981.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3985.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3986.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3987.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3989.JPG)\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3999.JPG)\n![Mammoth fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4002.JPG)\n![Pre-Historic Rhinoceroses fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_4005.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Don’t Miss These Highlights\n\nEvery part of the museum is special, but there are a few experiences that you should not miss:\n\n* **Cosmonova Dome Cinema** – Imagine sitting inside a giant half-globe where the movie surrounds you. One moment you are flying through space, the next you are diving under the sea. It feels so real that you almost forget you are in a chair.\n* **The Dinosaur Hall** – These ancient giants are always a favorite. Standing next to a dinosaur skeleton makes you feel very small.\n* **The Human Journey** – Walk step by step through how humans came to be. It’s like traveling back in time.\n* **Swedish Nature** – A beautiful exhibit that shows forests, lakes, animals, and birds from Sweden. It feels like being outside in nature, but indoors.\n* **Fossils and Gems** – Some sparkle, some look strange, but every stone tells a story millions of years old.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![The Giant Puffball](/images/nhms/IMG_3923.JPG)\n![5kg Lobster](/images/nhms/IMG_3926.JPG)\n![The Giant Crab](/images/nhms/IMG_3929.JPG)\n![The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3934.JPG)\n![My Daughter in front of The Giant Sequoia](/images/nhms/IMG_3933.JPG)\n![Iron meteorite](/images/nhms/IMG_3936.JPG)\n![Cross section of a Gigantic tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3952.JPG)\n![Human Evolution Tree](/images/nhms/IMG_3995.JPG)\n![Neanderthals](/images/nhms/IMG_4006.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## A Living Classroom\n\nWhat makes this museum stand out is how interactive it is. It is not just about looking – you can touch, listen, and explore. There are screens where you can read more, buttons to press, and activities for kids.\n\nIt honestly felt like a mix of school, play, and magic. My wife who studied biological science said it was like revisiting our university lessons, but in a fun way. That shows how much detail the museum gives – simple enough for kids, deep enough for adults.\n\n## Tips for Your Visit\n\nHere are some things I learned that will make your visit even better:\n\n* **Take your time.** The museum is huge. Plan at least 3–4 hours, or even more if you include Cosmonova.\n* **Book Cosmonova early.** Shows are popular, and each one takes time.\n* **Bring your own food.** The restaurant *Fossilen* is there, but I liked the calm seating area near the lockers. You can warm food in the microwave and enjoy your meal in peace.\n* **Dress light.** Inside it gets quite warm, even on cold days outside.\n* **Buy tickets online.** This saves you from standing in queues.\n* **Parking is easy.** The cheaper option is by the apartment buildings – only 50kr for the whole day.\n* **Perfect for rainy days.** The museum is all indoors, so it’s a cozy adventure.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3937.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3939.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3943.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3979.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3982.JPG)\n![fossils](/images/nhms/IMG_3983.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## As we finish\n\nWhen I left the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet, I felt like I had traveled through time, from the age of dinosaurs to the mysteries of space. This is not just a museum – it’s a living adventure.\n\nIf you are in Stockholm, **don’t miss it**. Whether you are with kids, friends, or even alone, you will come out with new knowledge, fun memories, and maybe even more questions about our amazing world.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet](/images/nhms/IMG_3909.JPG)\n![Underwater Life](/images/nhms/IMG_4013.JPG)\n![Dinosaurs Eggs](/images/nhms/IMG_3976.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n"},{"slug":"journey-to-catch-the-northern-lights-beyond-the-arctic-circle","title":"Under the Blue Hole: Our Journey to Catch the Northern Lights Beyond the Arctic Circle","date":"2025-08-15","tags":["scandinavia","sweden","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/winterabisko/IMG_4251.jpeg","content":"At the end of 2022, we had to renew our passports.\nFrom the quiet south of Sweden, we set our eyes on Stockholm, where the embassy waited. It would be a long, slow journey by train — six hours of rails stretching through frost and distance.\n\nBut winter has its own way of whispering temptations, and we listened.\nIf we were already traveling north, why not keep going? Why not continue past cities and forests, past the comfort of the familiar, to a place where the earth tilts toward the sky — Abisko, far beyond the Arctic Circle, seventeen hours by train from Stockholm.\n\nAfter the embassy appointment, we boarded the night train on the 29th of November, just after six in the evening. We had booked a sleeper cabin: warm, tidy, with a shower, thick blankets, and the comforting sense that the night would belong entirely to us. Our luggage was heavy with winter clothing; the forecasts spoke of -15°C.\n\nWe slept early, and so we woke early.\n\nIn the darkness, I pulled up the blind from the window. The world outside was not the one we had left. The train slid silently through a kingdom of white — frozen lakes, glassy rivers, mountains dressed in snow, and forests stripped bare except for the stubborn pines. Coming from a warm South Asian country, we had never seen such a thing: a landscape so still and pale it could have been another planet. We remained by the window, unwilling to close our eyes again, watching the ghostly scenery until the train whispered into Abisko around noon.\n\nIt was the 30th of November.\n\nAbisko is a small village in the shadow of Sweden’s mining town, Kiruna, and the mountains that cradle it. Only one grocery store stands here, its windows glowing faintly in the Polar Night — for in winter, the sun never rises above the horizon.\n\nAbisko is more than a village. It is a place of study, where scientists from around the world gather to measure the breath of the Arctic. Since 1913, the Abisko Scientific Research Station has recorded the winds, the snow, the slow thawing of permafrost. It is also a place where the sky holds a secret: a microclimate, the *blue hole*, which grants clearer skies than most of the Arctic. And in those skies, when the clouds part, the Northern Lights appear.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Abisko Central Station](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4027.JPG)\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4029.jpeg)\n![Abisko](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4031.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nOur hotel was a fifteen-minute walk from the station, along an icy road that shimmered under the dim light. We settled in, cooked simple meals from our grocery bags, played with our daughter in the snow, and wandered to the frozen lake to feel the silence.\n\nOn December 1st, we set out on the Nissunjåkka Suspension Bridge trail — 8.4 kilometers through birch forests and along the Abiskojokk River, the air so sharp it seemed to cut sound itself. There were moments when we were the only living souls in sight. Three and a half hours later, we returned to the hotel under a sky that refused to turn day. That night, we walked again toward the lake, hoping the heavens might open — but the clouds remained, and the sky kept its secret.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4167.jpeg)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4180.JPG)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_1881.jpeg)\n![NSB trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4206.jpeg)\n![slipped in icy river](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4155.jpeg)\n![mountains and lake](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4354.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next day, we traced another path: the Östra Loop Trail, 11.3 kilometers of snow, river, and canyon. Words cannot hold the beauty of Abisko in winter; it is not something seen but something breathed. Still, the sky stayed veiled, and we began to think ourselves unlucky.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4301.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4292.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4290.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4280.jpeg)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_4300.JPG)\n![OL trail](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2095.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIt was my wife who suggested the chase.\nThe hotel organized nightly journeys for those unwilling to leave without seeing the aurora. That night, December 2nd, at nine o’clock, we boarded one of three small buses with travelers from across the world. Our guide was from Argentina, now a man of the north, and we spoke of Maradona and the mad devotion of Bangladesh to football.\n\nThe chase was a patient game. We drove from valley to ridge, from frozen road to silent clearing, looking for a patch of sky with fewer clouds. Finally, the guide stopped and stepped out into the freezing night. Coffee and warm lingonberry juice were passed around. We waited. The cold sank into our bones.\n\nThen — a shout.\n\nWe looked up. At first, we saw nothing but the night. The guide told us to keep looking, to let our eyes learn. Slowly, faint grains of light gathered overhead, as if someone were sifting silver dust across the heavens. The shapes thickened, spread, twisted. The sky began to move. Green ribbons unfurled, curling and folding like smoke in a wind only the stars could feel. Light danced from one edge of the horizon to the other, fading in one place as it flared in another.\n\nIt lasted perhaps twenty minutes, perhaps forever.\n\nWe stood there, strangers bound together by awe, each of us quietly aware that we were inside a memory we would never lose. I had seen the aurora later, from the backyard of our home in southern Sweden, but never like this — in the deep of the Arctic night, with the whole sky breathing above us.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2141.jpeg)\n![aurora](/images/winterabisko/IMG_2120.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nThe next morning, we began the long journey south. The light we had chased stayed with us, a flicker behind the eyes, as if some part of the north had followed us home.\n"},{"slug":"the-brutally-honest-guide-to-getting-a-swedish-driving-license","title":"The Brutally Honest Guide to Getting a Swedish Driving License (Without Going Broke or Losing Your Mind)","date":"2025-08-14","tags":["sweden","driving","life","tips"],"coverImage":"/images/driving_license/4q8l084q8l084q8l.jpg","author":"","content":"\nObtaining a driving license in Sweden is quite a challenging process — both mentally and financially.\n\nThe country has clearly defined standards and checkpoints that you must meet to pass. It is mentally demanding because instructors and examiners may fail you for even a small deviation from those standards. For example, when turning right, if you check the rear-view mirror and right mirror but forget to check your right-side blind spot, you will fail.\n\n## Financial Reality\n\nFor many Swedes, the process is easier financially. They often get support from their parents, who can act as instructors and provide a car for practice. Before taking the real exam, they may have 100–500 hours of driving practice. Statistically, it is said that you need at least 200 hours of driving to develop strong muscle memory.\n\nFor newcomers like me, it’s even more frustrating. We may not know the Swedish language or culture, and even if we already have a license from another country, our driving style may be seen as aggressive here. In many cases, we must relearn driving entirely according to Swedish standards.\n\nIf you rely fully on driving schools, money becomes a major factor. One lesson costs around 1,200 SEK for 80 minutes (at the time of this writing). To reach 200 hours through a school, you’d need around 150 lessons — costing about **180,000 SEK**.\n\nIn practice, if you have prior driving experience, you might need a minimum 30–40 lessons (around 48,000 SEK). For complete beginners 40-100 lessons, costs can easily reach 100,000 SEK. If you plan to rely entirely on a driving school, save this money beforehand based on your situation. Pausing midway and resuming later often means retaking many lessons.\n\n## Time Commitment\n\nTime is another key factor. You’ll need to dedicate time for studying, dealing with frustration, and even walking around to learn local roads and traffic conditions. If you’re already stressed, pursuing a license will feel much harder.\n\nIdeally, set aside **2–4 months** to focus on your driving license as a top priority during that period.\n\n**Seasonal tip:** Plan your entire activity so that your practical exam falls around **July or August**. For example:\n\n- March: Begin the process and apply for your learner’s permit.\n- April: Finish reading the theory book.\n- April–May: Focus on theory studies.\n- May–July: Practical driving lessons.\n- July–August: Take your practical exam.\n\nThis plan gives you long daylight hours for practice, which is much easier than learning in winter darkness.\n\n## Sweden’s Road Safety Approach\n\nSweden aims to minimize accidents and fatalities through strict standards and defensive driving principles. Drivers are expected to anticipate potential hazards and act appropriately in any situation. A driving license may offer freedom, but it comes with serious responsibility.\n\nUnderstanding the [**standard checkpoints**](https://trafikverket.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1389795/FULLTEXT04.pdf) before your exam is critical. I highly recommend reading [this free online theory book](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/K%C3%B6rkortonline_se_Theory_Book_Driving_Licence_Book?id=PzWxEAAAQBAJ) to get a solid grasp of what Transportstyrelsen expects from drivers. I even recommend it to city cyclists and predistrans.\n\n## Steps to Get a Driving License in Sweden (B-Type)\n\n> All the following information applies to a **B-type driving license**.\n\n### 1. Eye Test\n\nMake sure your vision meets the requirements. Visit any optician and request an eye exam for a driving license. The optician will send the results directly to Transportstyrelsen. This usually costs 100–150 SEK.\n\n### 2. Learner’s Permit\n\nOnce your eye test is approved, you can apply for a learner’s permit.\n\n### 3. Risk Training\n\n**Risk 1 (Riskettan)**\nA theoretical course covering alcohol, drugs, fatigue, and other risky behaviors that impair driving. Cost: 400–1,100 SEK.\n\n**Risk 2 (Halkbana)**\nA practical course that teaches handling dangerous situations, especially skidding on slippery roads — common in Nordic winters. Cost: 2,000–3,000 SEK.\n\nBoth Risk 1 and Risk 2 are valid for **five years**. You can search for [authorised instructors offering risk courses here](https://lisutb-p.transportstyrelsen.se/extweb/#/).\n\n### 4. Theory Study\n\nCovers traffic rules, signs, safety, vehicle knowledge, and eco-driving.\n\n- Course cost: 400–1,500 SEK (depending on provider).\n- 70 multiple-choice questions (5 are trial questions and don’t count).\n- Passing score: 52 correct answers.\n- Duration: 50 minutes.\n- Theory test cost: 420–520 SEK.\n- Pass is valid for **four months**.\n\nThere are many online theory practice tools — choose one that suits you. You can study through a driving school, but it’s not mandatory.\n\n**Tip:** Alternate theory study with practical lessons to reinforce learning.\n\n### 5. Practical Lessons\n\nYou can train at a driving school, with a private instructor, or both. Private practice requires an [introductory course with your supervising driver at an approved school](https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/en/road/driving-licences/permits-for-driving-training/).\n\nSince lessons are expensive, book them when you are calm and focused. Have at least a one-hour buffer before and after each lesson to avoid stress.\n\nStick to one instructor if possible. Changing schools often disrupts progress and costs more in the long run.\n\n### 6. Practical Exam\n\n- Cost: 1,000–1,400 SEK.\n- Best time slots: ***09:30*** –***11:00*** or ***13:30*** –***15:30*** for lighter traffic.\n- Aim for summer months when roads are quieter and weather is favorable.\n- It matters where you practice and where you book your exam. Target the practical exam center first, then focus your practice in that city. This way, you’ll become familiar with local roads, traffic patterns, and common challenges in that area. Generally, the quieter the city, the higher your chances of passing the exam on the first try.\n\n## Cheaper Alternatives\n\n- If you’ve been a Swedish resident for less than a year and have a valid non-EEA license, you can drive for one year. During this time, buy a cheap car, practice, study theory, take some lessons, and then book your test.\n- Some people swap licenses in another country first (e.g., Denmark) and then exchange them for a Swedish license — if their original license is swappable there.\n\n## Foreign Driving Licenses in Sweden\n\n- **Non-EEA licenses**: Valid for 1 year after becoming a Swedish resident. After that, you must pass the Swedish tests.\n- **EEA licenses**: Valid until expiry. You can also swap them for a Swedish license.\n\n## Summing up\n\n![Swedish Driving License Checklist](/images/driving_license/sweden_driving_license_checklist.png)\n\nThe two most important factors are **time** and **money**. Set aside the full budget so you don’t have to stop midway, and dedicate 3–5 months of focused effort. The rest is discipline, patience, and persistence.\n\nIf you think I’ve missed something or have experiences of your own to share, feel free to leave a comment below. Your insight might help others who are on the same journey.\n"},{"slug":"from-forest-trails-to-glaciers-our-most-unforgettable-week-in-norway","title":"From Forest Trails to Glaciers: Our Most Unforgettable Week in Norway","date":"2025-08-06","tags":["scandinavia","itinerary","travel"],"coverImage":"/images/norway2025/1.jpg","content":"\nYou know that smart idea you have when you’re already tired? That’s how this trip started.\n\nWe had just finished moving apartments — in the middle of summer, sweating like we were in a gym we didn’t sign up for. Our backs ached, our muscles felt like jelly, and the idea of packing again for a vacation sounded like punishment.\n\nBut then… the little voice in my head went, “You know what you need? A road trip.”\n\nAnd not just any road trip — a 7-day drive through central and western Norway. Because obviously, the cure for exhaustion is… more exhaustion.\n\n## The Drone Plan\n\nTo spice things up, we bought a drone. Not the toy kind — the one that makes you feel like a movie director.\n\nOf course, in Europe, you can’t just fly a drone wherever you want unless you like paying fines the size of a small car. So the week before the trip, I was cramming drone pilot courses like a college student before finals.\n\nBy the time we left, I had my EU license, the drone was charged, and I was ready to terrorize seagulls across Norway.\n\n## Setting the Route\n\nWe had 7 days. 2 would disappear in just getting from Sweden to Norway and back. That left 5 days to:\n\n- Drive scenic roads\n- See waterfalls, fjords, and glaciers\n- Take more drone shots than a human should\n\nOne driver, one rest day in the middle, and one big rule: the trip’s mission was to touch a glacier.\n\nTrollstigen — the legendary mountain road — had just opened for the season, so it became our farthest point before turning back. But the real prize was Bøyabreen Glacier in Fjærland.\n\nThe route looked like this:\nOslo → Trollstigen → Geiranger → Bøyabreen Glacier, Fjærland → Flåm → Oslo\n\n## Packing Like a Doomsday Prepper\n\nNorway is beautiful, but if you shop there too much, your wallet starts crying. So we packed like we were going on an Arctic survival mission:\n\n- Portable stove & gas cans\n- Canned food, protein bars, fruit, nuts\n- Coffee & tea (because you don’t mess with caffeine supply)\n\nThe plan was simple — cook in scenic spots, avoid overpriced restaurants, and stay away from big cities as much as possible.\n\n## Day 1 – Sweden → Oslo\n\nThe morning of 19th July was golden and warm, with that gentle breeze that makes you think the world’s in a good mood. We left at 9 a.m., windows down, music up, and the back of the car rattling with camping gear.\n\nAbout two hours in, we pulled over at a rest stop — one of those quiet roadside spots where the only sound is the wind in the trees and the occasional truck rumbling past. We unpacked the stove, chopped up some vegetables, and fried them in the open air. The smell of sizzling onions mixed with pine trees and hot asphalt — oddly comforting.\n\nWhile lunch was cooking, I unpacked the drone. The first flight was shaky, my fingers a little clumsy, but within minutes I was zipping it over the tree line, watching the tiny live feed of endless forest.\n\nBy late afternoon, Oslo’s skyline appeared. My wife’s friend met us at the door with that big smile only old friends give you. Inside, the smell of Bangladeshi spices hit me first — warm, homey, like a hug for your stomach. We ate until we couldn’t move.\n\n## Day 2 – Oslo → Lesjaskogsvatnet Camping\n\nWe rolled out of Oslo around 10 a.m., our trusty volvo v60 humming along narrow roads lined with red-painted houses..\n\nFirst stop was Ringebu Stave Church. The wooden walls were the color of dark honey, weathered by centuries of wind and snow. Inside, the air smelled of dry wood and history. You could almost hear the shuffle of boots from hundreds of years ago.\n\nNext was Myfallet Waterfall. The road there narrowed into something that looked like a driveway, ending in a barrier. We hiked through a forest so green it looked fake, the air heavy with the smell of wet leaves. The waterfall roared in the distance before we even saw it.\n\nWe couldn’t resist — we waded into the river. The water was cool and sharp, the kind that makes you gasp at first but then feels perfect on a warm summer day.\n\nBy then, we were too tired for our third planned stop. We headed straight to Lesjaskogsvatnet Camping, a lake so still it reflected the mountains like a mirror. The only sound was the soft slap of water against the shore. That evening, we flew the drone as the sky turned orange, the lake glowing like molten gold.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Ringebu Stave Church](/images/norway2025/DJI_0019.jpeg)\n![Myfallet](/images/norway2025/DJI_0029.jpeg)\n![Mya River](/images/norway2025/myfallet.jpeg)\n![Lesjaskogsvatnet Lake](/images/norway2025/DJI_0030.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 3 – Trollstigen & Geiranger\n\nWe started early.\n\nTrollstigen is not just a road — it’s a dare. Eleven hairpin bends, a 10% incline, and cliffs so steep you wonder if the guardrails are just decorative. Waterfalls burst out of the rock on both sides.\n\nFrom the top, Trollstigen looked unreal — a silver ribbon curling down the mountainside in eleven tight bends. We sent the drone gliding over the valley, capturing the tiny cars far below, the waterfalls crashing down beside them, and the still blue lake above, quietly feeding all that power.\n\nBy midday, we reached Geiranger. The fjord was glassy blue, framed by cliffs and waterfalls with names like “Seven Sisters” and “The Bridal Veil.” Unfortunately, it was also packed with tourists — cruise ships, buses, and people everywhere. The smell of sunscreen and fried food floated in the warm air. We didn’t linger.\n\nWe ended the day at Djupvatnet Lake, high in the mountains. The air was thin and cool, the water so clear it was like looking into another world. The drone footage here is a Chef’s kiss.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Trollstigen road](/images/norway2025/trolls_1.jpeg)\n![Trollstigen](/images/norway2025/trolls_2.jpeg)\n![Geirangerfjord](/images/norway2025/gei_01.jpeg)\n![Seven Sisters Waterfall](/images/norway2025/gei_02.jpeg)\n![Geirangerfjord](/images/norway2025/gei_03.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 4 – Sunnfjord: The Lake, The Fish, The Waterfall\n\nThis was supposed to be a lazy day. Just 122 km.\n\nWe reached our cottage by early afternoon — and our jaws dropped. On two sides: mountains. On another: a crystal-clear lake, greenish-blue, so calm it felt wrong to disturb it, and in front of us: a roaring waterfall straight from the glacier.\n\nWe dumped our bags and ran straight into the lake water. It was cold enough to make my chest tighten — but then came the tickling. Fish, tiny and curious, nibbling at our toes. Nature’s spa treatment.\n\nLater, we took the canoe out. Every stroke of the paddle sent ripples across the mirrored surface, mountains and sky bending and breaking in the water. Flying the drone from the canoe was a whole new level of tricky — first, I had to train my wife to steer us smoothly with the paddle. Only then could I focus on getting the shots, balancing the controls while the boat kept moving under me.\n\nThat night, we sat on the balcony with mugs of hot tea, watching the glacier glow under the fading light.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s1.jpeg)\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s2.jpeg)\n![Sunnfjord](/images/norway2025/s3.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 5 – Mission: Touch the Glacier\n\nFrom the viewpoint, Bøyabreen Glacier looked close — like you could stroll over in 15 minutes. Lies.\n\nWe decided to hike to it. The path was barely a path — mud, dense forest, then swamps so cold they made our bones ache. Our feet went numb, came back to life, then went numb again. At one point, we had to climb over a fallen tree, water sloshing inside our shoes.\n\nFinally, the forest opened up into a rocky slope. Above us, the glacier loomed — blue and white, massive and alive, groaning softly as it shifted. Below, we could see chunks of ice breaking off in the glacier calving, crashing into the cold water. Waterfalls poured down the cliffs nearby, their spray mixing with a gentle rain that cooled our faces. There was no one else around — just us, the wind, the falling ice, and the steady drip of melting glacier water.\n\nWe touched it. Hard, smooth, older than anything I’d ever touched before. My wife stacked some rocks into a little tower — our mark that we’d made it.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Bøyabreen Glacier](/images/norway2025/g1.jpeg)\n![Bøyabreen Glacier Viewpoint](/images/norway2025/g2.jpeg)\n![Bøyabreen Glacier Viewpoint](/images/norway2025/g3.jpeg)\n![Mammoths!](/images/norway2025/g4.jpg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 6 – Fjærland → Flåm\n\nFlåm was quieter than Geiranger, with the fjord stretching out like a silver ribbon. We drove up to Stegastein viewpoint — a platform hanging over the valley. The air was sharp and cool, the kind that wakes you up from the inside out.\n\nWe flew the drone here until the wind picked up, and even the drone seemed to say, “Nope.”\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![Flåm](/images/norway2025/f1.jpeg)\n![Aurlandsfjord](/images/norway2025/f2.jpeg)\n![Stegastein](/images/norway2025/f3.jpeg)\n<!--gallery-->\n\n## Day 7 – Flåm → Oslo → Sweden\n\nWe stopped in Oslo again to see friends. Their living room smelled of fresh coffee and warm food. We stayed too long, laughed too much, and ate until I thought I’d need a nap before driving.\n\nWe left at 4 p.m., the road fading from mountains to the flat Swedish countryside. Pulled into home at 1 a.m., car dusty, drone batteries dead, and memory cards full.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODvbeGMV8Bk\n\nNorway isn’t just scenery — it’s a mood, a smell, a shock of cold water on your skin, a silence so deep you hear your own heartbeat. It’s the taste of coffee at a roadside stop with mountains in every direction. And for me, it’s the feeling of ice under my hand in the middle of summer."},{"slug":"this-cheap-drone-made-my-norway-trip-epic","title":"This Cheap Drone Made My Norway Trip Epic","date":"2025-08-01","tags":["travel","tech","norway","drone"],"coverImage":"/images/drone/dji_fly_20250723_205706_101_1753297038727_photo_optimized-1024x576.jpeg","content":"\nJust before heading out on our summer road trip in Norway, Amazon started showing me ads for DJI drones — and guess what? The DJI Mini 4K was 50 euros cheaper than usual! A drone, on sale, right before our trip? That sounded like the perfect spice to add to our scenic journey — especially with our 13th marriage anniversary coming up!\n\nWithout thinking too much, I ordered the DJI Mini 4K drone.\n\nNow, I’m not a complete newbie when it comes to drones. Back in Bangladesh, one of my close friends is a professional drone operator and a pioneer in drone-related services - [CygnusAerial](https://cygnusaerial.com/). I’ve spent a good amount of time with him, absorbing drone knowledge over tea and tech talk. Once, I even had the chance to fly a professional drone with him over an archaeological site in Bangladesh.\n\nThen I moved to Sweden. After a while, I bought a toy drone — nothing fancy, but it kept me entertained for a year. Then came a long break… until now.\n\nOnce the order was placed, all sorts of questions started popping into my head:\n\n*Can I still fly a drone after all these years? Will I manage to take professional-looking shots? Am I even allowed to fly a drone in Norway? Or in Europe in general? What if it crashes? What if it hits someone or damages a vehicle?!*\n\nPanic mode has been activated!\n\nI even tried to cancel the order. But alas! Amazon informed me that the order was already at the final stage of fulfillment and could no longer be canceled. Ahhh!\n\nSo, instead of returning the drone once it arrived, I decided to face my fears and dig for answers. And guess what? I found a treasure trove of info that I’m going to share with you here.\n\n## First Things First: Can You Fly a Drone in Europe?\n\nYes! You can. But there are a few conditions. Let’s break it down.\n\nDrones in Europe are regulated under rules set by **EASA** (European Union Aviation Safety Agency). The good news? There’s a structured system. The bad news? You probably need a license.\n\nDrones are categorized under the **Open Category** for low-risk operations. This is divided into three subcategories:\n\n1. **class C0**: weight under 250g, allowed to fly over people but not over crowda, usually not required license.\n2. **class C1**: weight under 900g, allowed to fly near people but not over crowds, usually requires A1 license to fly.\n3. **class C2**: weight under 4kg, allowed to fly near people with distance, usually requires A2 license to fly such drones.\n4. **class C3 - C4**: weight under 25kg, should fly far from people, usually requires A3 license to fly such UAS(Unmanned Aircraft System).\n\nYou can usually find the class label on your drone or its packaging. If there’s no class marking (as with older drones), stricter rules apply.\n\n[🔗 More on EASA’s official site](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/domains/drones-air-mobility/operating-drone/open-category-low-risk-civil-drones)\n\n## Is a License Enough?\n\nShort answer: Nope.\n\nIn most European countries, you’re strongly advised — and often required — to have **public liability insurance** for your drone. Even the best drone pilots have unexpected crashes. If your drone hits a person, car, or property, you’ll be responsible for any damages. Public liability insurance covers these risks.\n\nIt’s not expensive and gives peace of mind. Many insurers offer drone-specific coverage — just make sure it fits your usage (recreational vs. commercial).\n\n## Modern Drone Tech: Insanely Smart!\n\nMy other concern was — would I be able to capture good drone footage? From my previous experience (as I mentioned earlier), I know that getting truly great shots takes both skill and practice. Drone footage isn’t just about pressing record — it’s about knowing angles, timing, lighting, and movement.\n\nLuckily, modern drones are packed with features that make capturing stunning footage easier than ever — even for someone a bit out of practice like me.Here are just a few features in modern drones like the DJI Mini 4K:\n\n* **Obstacle avoidance**: Sensors help avoid trees, walls, and even power lines. In fact it can detect unevent ground to avoid crash landing!\n\n* **Return to Home**: Automatically returns to launch point if battery is low or signal is lost. I have used this feature most of the times. In fact this feature saved the drone twice.\n\n* **GPS-based stability**: Makes flying smooth, even in windy conditions.\n\n* **Follow-me and auto-tracking**: The drone follows you or a subject automatically!\n\n* **QuickShots and cinematic modes**: Tap a button and it does perfect orbits, spirals, or boomerangs. You just can take movie grade shots just clicking couple of buttons.\n\n* **4K gimbal-stabilized video**: Butter-smooth footage, straight out of the sky.\n\nIn short: even if you’re not Spielberg, your drone might make it look like you are.\n\n## Local Laws & GDPR: Know Before You Fly\n\nNow here’s something important people often overlook: **local regulations**.\n\nEven though you’re allowed to fly drones in Europe under general categories, local rules still apply — and they can change *from one town to the next*.\n\n* Don’t fly near **airports**, **military zones**, **prisons**, **government buildings**, or **restricted airspace**.\n\n* Most of the countries have **national park restrictions**.\n\n* Always check for **temporary flight restrictions (TFRs)** — like during public events or emergencies.\n\nAlso, be **GDPR-compliant**. What’s that?\n\n> **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation) is Europe’s privacy law. It means: don’t film people without their permission, especially in private areas. If your drone captures identifiable people in sensitive places — you could face complaints or even legal action.\n\nUse apps or official websites to check **no-fly zones and airspace restrictions** before every flight. It’s a small effort that saves big headaches.\n\n## How I Got My Drone License in Norway\n\nSo here’s what I did:\n\n1. **Registered at flydrone.no**. You can sign up as a private person, an organization, or a drone pilot.\n2. After a few hours, they approved my application and sent a payment link.\n3. I paid around **20 euros** for the year.\n4. Then I selected the **A1/A3 course** — which is good for most hobby flights.\n5. After going through the course materials, I took the **online exam**, which was a simple multiple-choice test.\n6. **Boom**! Passed it, got the license, and I was good to go!\n\n![My Drone License](/images/drone/license.jpeg)\n\nOnce you have a drone license from any EASA member country, it’s valid across all of Europe (within the EASA zone). That means my Norwegian license lets me fly in countries like France, Spain, Germany, and others — as long as I follow their local laws and restrictions. Pretty convenient!\n\nFor the **A2 license**, you need extra skills and have to take an in-person exam at a local traffic station.\n\n## Norway Road Trip with My Drone – Watch the Videos\n\nYes — I flew the drone!

Recently I have had a road trip on different parts of Norway and I got curious about these intriguing creatures. I delved into the world of trolls.\n\nTrolls are a fundamental part of Norwegian culture, deeply embedded in art, literature, and media. These mythical beings are often depicted in traditional Norwegian fairy tales and folklore, where they range from menacing antagonists to simple, nature-bound creatures.\n\nIn Norwegian lore, trolls are depicted as real beings living in mountains, forests, or caves. They are often large, connected to nature, and antagonistic towards humans and gods alike. Remarkably, trolls were even mentioned in Norwegian Christian laws, which forbade people from eating with them or waking them up at night.\n\n<!--gallery-->\n![William](/images/trolls_1.JPG)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls_2.JPG)\n![Bert](/images/trolls_3.JPG)\n![Branch](/images/trolls_4.JPG)\n![Poppy](/images/trolls_5.JPG)\n<!--gallery-->\n\nIn literature and folklore, trolls are usually portrayed as ugly, aggressive creatures with a love for mischief and trickery. They symbolize chaos and disruption and are often associated with the wild, untamed aspects of nature. These stories also spread to Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland, making trolls a common figure in Scandinavian folklore.\n\nInterestingly, the word ‘troll’ likely originated from the Norwegian words for witches and witchcraft, “trollfolk” and “trolldom,” respectively. This etymology hints at the deep-rooted mysticism and fear surrounding these creatures.\n\nBut trolls aren’t just confined to old tales. They have found a place in modern culture as well. From the charmingly mischievous troll dolls popularized in the 1960s to the trolls in the “Frozen” movies, these mythical beings continue to capture our imagination. There’s even a genre of Scandinavian horror films that bring trolls to life in contemporary settings, blending ancient myths with modern-day storytelling.\n\nSo, the next time you encounter a troll statue in Norway or hear a story about these enigmatic creatures, remember that you’re tapping into a rich tapestry of folklore that has been woven over centuries. Whether seen as fearsome giants or mischievous tricksters, trolls remain an enduring and fascinating part of Norwegian culture.\n\nIn case want to dive more into trolls here are some movies and books:\n\n***Movies:***\n\n1.
